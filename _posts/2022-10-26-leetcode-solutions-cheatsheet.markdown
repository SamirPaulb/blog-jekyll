# 1-Two Sum 

Given an array of integers, return **indices** of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:
```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

<br><br>
<a name="twoSumBruteForce"></a>
## Brute Force 

```java 
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
	for (int i=0; i<nums.size; i++){
		for (int j=i+1;j<nums.length;j++){
			if (nums[j]==target-nums[i]){
				return new int[] {i,j};
			}
		}
	}
	throw new IllegalArgumentException("No two sum solution");
} 
```
**Complexity Analysis** 
```
* Time complexity:   O(n^2)       we have a nested loop 
* Space complexity:  O(1) 	  we do not allocate any additional memory
```
<a name="twoSumOnePassHashTable"></a>
## One Pass Hash Table 

```java 
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
	Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
	for(int i=0; i<nums.length; i++){
		int complement=target-nums[i];
		if (map.containsKey(complement)){
			return new int[] {map.get(complement),i};
		}
		map.put(nums[i],i);
	}
	throw new IllegalArgumentException("No two sum solution"); 
}
```
**Complexity Analysis**
```
* Time complexity:   O(n)		each lookup in the hash table only requires O(1) time
* Space complexity:  O(n)		we require additional space for the hash table which stores at most n

# 3-Substring No Repeat 

Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters 

Given a string find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. 

```
Example
Input: 		"abcabcbb"
Output:		3
Explanation:	The answer is "abc", with the length of 3
```
```
Example 2
Input:		"bbbbb"
Output:		1
Explanation:	The answer is "b", with the length of 1
```
```
Example 3
Input:		"pwwkew"
Output:		3
Explanation: 	The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring
		"pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring 
```

<br><br>
<a name="substringNoRepeatBruteForce"></a>
## Brute Force 

*Algorithm* 


Suppose we have a function "boolean allUnique(String substring)" which returns true if all the
characters in the substring are unique and false otherwise. We can iterate through all the possible 
substrings of the given string s and call the function allUnique. If it turns out to be true, then we 
update our answer of the maximum length of substring without duplicate characters. 

To enumerate all substrings of a given string we enumerate the start and end indices of them. Suppose
the start and end indices are i and j respectively. Then we have 0 <= i <= j <= n. Thus using two 
nested loops with i from 0 to n-1 and j from i+1 to n, we can enumerate all the substrings of s

To check if one string has duplicate characters we can use a set. We iterate through all the 
characters in the string and put them into the set one by one. Before putting one character, we check
if the set already contains it. If so we return false and after the loop we return true.


```java 
public class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            for (int j = i + 1; j <= n; j++)
                if (allUnique(s, i, j)) ans = Math.max(ans, j - i);
        return ans;
    }

    public boolean allUnique(String s, int start, int end) {
        Set<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i = start; i < end; i++) {
            Character ch = s.charAt(i);
            if (set.contains(ch)) return false;
            set.add(ch);
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

**Complexity Analysis** 

```
* Time Complexity:   O(n^3)		Verifying if characters in   [i,j) are unique requires us to scan all of
					them which would cost O(j-i) time. 

					For a given i, the sum of time costed by each j -> [i+1,n] is 
					"Summation from i+1 to n O(j-1)"

					Thus, the sum of all the time consumption is: 
					O(summation from 0 to n-1(summation from j=i+1 to n (j-1))) 
					O(summation from i=0 to n-1(1+n-i)(n-i)/2)) = O(n^3)


					*Note that the sum of all numbers up to n 1+2+3+...+n = n(n+1)/2


* Space Complexity:  O(min(n,m))	We require O(k) space for checking a substring has no duplicate 
					characters, where k is the size of the set. The size of the Set is 
					upper bounded by the size of the string n amd the size of the charset
					or alphabet m

<a name="substringNoRepeatSlidingWindow"></a>
## Sliding Window 

A sliding window is an abstract concept commonly used in array/string problems. A window is a range of 
elements in the array/string which usually defined by the start and end indices
```
Ex. [i,j) left-closed, right-open
```
A sliding window is a window that slides its two boundaries in a certain direction, for example if we
slide \[i,j) to the right by 1 element, then it becomes \[i+1, j+1) - left closed, right open.



Sliding Window approach, whenever we are looking at a section on an array usual to perform calculations
we don't need to completely recalculate everything for every section of the array. Usually we can use
the value obtained from another section of the array to determine something about this section of the 
array. For example if we are calculating the sum of sections of an array we can use the previously 
calculated value of a section to determine the sum of an adjacent section in the array. 
```
Ex. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 
```
If we calculate the first section of four values we get 1+2+3+4 = 10 , then to calculate the next section
2+3+4+5 we can just take our first section (window_sum) and perform the operation: 
```
window_sum-first entry + last entry = 10-1+5= 14
```
So essentially for the window sliding technique we use what we know about an existing window to 
determine properties for another window. 

<br><br>
*Algorithm*

In the brute force approach, we repeatedly check a substring to see if it has duplicate characters but
this is unnecessary. If a substring from index i to j-1 is already checked to have no duplicate 
characters we only need to check if s[j] is already in the substring. 

To check if a character is already in the substring we can scan the substring which leads to an O(n^2)
algorithm but we can improve on this runtime using a HashSet as a sliding window to check if a 
character exists in the current set O(1). 

We use a HashSet to store the characters in the current window \[i,j) and then we slide the index j to
the right, if it is not in the HashSet, we slide j further until s[j] is already in the HashSet. At
this point we found the maximum size of substrings without duplicate characters starting with index i.
If we do this for all i, then we obtain our answer. 


```java 
public class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        Set<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
        int ans = 0, i = 0, j = 0;
        while (i < n && j < n) {
            // try to extend the range [i, j]
            if (!set.contains(s.charAt(j))){
                set.add(s.charAt(j++));
                ans = Math.max(ans, j - i);
            }
            else {
                set.remove(s.charAt(i++));
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**
```
Time complexity:	O(2n)=O(n)	Worst case each character will be visited twice by i and j

Space complexity: 	O(min(m,n))	Same as the brute force method, we need O(k) space for the 
					sliding window where k is the size of the set. The size of the
					set is bounded by the size of the string n and the size of the
					charset/alphabet m
```


<br><br>
<a name="substringNoRepeatOptimized"></a>
## Sliding Window Optimized 

The previously discussed sliding window approach requires at most 2n steps and this could in fact be
optimized even further to require only n steps. Instead of using a set to tell if a character exists or
not, we could define a mapping of the characters to its index. Then we can skip the characters 
immediately when we found a repeated character 

If s[j] has a duplicate in the range \[i , j) with index j', we don't need to increase i little be little
we can just skip all the elements in the range \[i , j'] and let i be j'+1 directly 

```java 
public class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        int n = s.length(), ans = 0;
        Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>(); // current index of character
        // try to extend the range [i, j]
        for (int j = 0, i = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (map.containsKey(s.charAt(j))) {
                i = Math.max(map.get(s.charAt(j)), i);
            }
            ans = Math.max(ans, j - i + 1);
            map.put(s.charAt(j), j + 1);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

<a name="medianofTwoSortedArrays"></a>
# 4-Median of Two Sorted Arrays 

There are two sorted arrays num1 and num2 of size m and n respectively. Find the median of the two 
sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)). You may assume nums1 and nums2
cannot be both empty. 

```
Example 

nums1 = [1, 3] 
nums2 = [2]

The median is 2.0
```

```
Example 2

nums1= [1, 2] 
nums2= [3, 4] 

The median is (2+3)/2 = 2.5
```


<br><br>
<a name="medianofTwoSortedArraysRecursiveApproach"></a>
## Recursive Approach

In statistics the median is used for dividing a set into two equal length subsets with one set being
always greater than the other set. To approach this problem first we cut A into two parts at a random
position i: 

```
         left_A                |           right_A 

  A[0], A[1], ... , A[i-1]         A[i], A[i+1], ... , A[m-1]
```

Since A has m elements, there are m+1 kinds of cutting as i can range from 0-m. We can also see that
left_A is empty when i is zero and right_A is empty when i=m

```
len(left_A) = i and len(right_A)= m-i
```

We can similarly cut B into two parts at a random position j: 

```
	left_B			|	right_B

  B[0], B[1], ... , B[j-1]	   B[j], B[j+1], ... , B[n-1]
```
  
Now if we put left_A and left_B into one set and put right_A and right_B into another set and name 
them left_part and right_part, then we get

```
	left_part		|	right_part
  A[0], A[1], ... , A[i-1]	  A[i], A[i+1], ... , A[m-1]
  B[0], B[1], ... , B[j-1]	  B[j], B[j+1], ... , B[n-1]
```

If we can ensure that 
1. the len(left_part) = len(right_part)
2. max(left_part) <= min(right_part)

then we divide all the elements in {A,B} into two parts with equal length and one part is always
greater than the other. Then 

```
median= (max(left_part)+min(right_part))/2
```
To ensure these two conditions, we need to ensure: 
1. i+j= m-i+n-j (or: m-i+n-j+1) if n>m, we just need to set i=0~m, j= (m+n+1)/2 - i
2. B\[j-1]<=A\[i] and A\[i-1]<=B\[j]

So, all we need to do is search for i in \[0,m] to find an object i such that 
B\[j-1]<=A\[i] and A\[i-1]<=B\[j] where j=(m+n+1)/2 -i

Then we perform a binary search following the steps described below: 

1) Set imin=0, imax=0, then start searching in \[imin, imax]
2) Set i=(imin+imax)/2 , j=(m+n+1)/2 - i
3) Now we have len(left_part) = len(right_part) and there are only 3 more situations which we may 
   encounter: 
   
```
   - B[j-1] <= A[i] and A[i-1]<=B[j] 
     This means that we have found the object i, so we can stop searching

   - B[j-1] > A[i]
     Means A[i] is too small, we must adjust i to get B[j-1]<=A[i] so we increase i because this will
     cuase j to be decreased. We cannot decrease i because when i is decreased, j will be increased
     so B[j-1] is increased and A[i] is decreased (B[j-1]<= A[i] will never be satisfied)

   - A[i-1] > B[j] 
     Means A[i-1] is too big and thus we must decrease i to get A[i-1]<=B[j]. In order to do that we 
     must adjust the searching range to [imin, i-1] so we set imax=i-1 and go back to step 2
```
When the object i is found, then the media is: 

 max(A\[i-1],B\[j-1]), when m+n is odd
(max(A\[i-1],B\[j-1])+min(A\[i],B\[j]))/2, when m+n is even

Next is to consider the edge values i=0, i=m, j=0, j=n where A\[i-1], B\[j-1], A\[i], B\[j] may not exist

```java 
class Solution {
	public double findMedianSortedArrays(int[] A, int[] B) {
		int m=A.length;
		int n=B.length;
		if (m>n) {   	//ensuring that m<=n
			int[] temp=A; A=B; B=temp;
			int tmp=m; m=n; n=tmp;
		}
		int iMin=0, iMax=m, halfLen=(m+n+1)/2;
		while (iMin<=iMax) {
			int i=(iMin+iMax)/2
			int j= halfLen - i;
			if (i<iMax && B[j-1] > A[i]){
				iMin=i+1; //i is too small
			}
			else if (i>iMin && A[i-1]>B[j]) {
				iMax=i-1; //i is too big
			}
			else{ //we have found the object i 
				int maxLeft=0; 
				if (i==0) {
					maxLeft=B[j-1];
				}
				else if (j==0){
					maxLeft=A[i-1];
				}
				else{
					maxLeft=Math.max(A[i-1], B[j-1]);
				}

				if ((m+n)%2 ==1) {
					return maxLeft;
				}

				int minRIght=0;
				if (i==m) {
					minRight=B[j];
				}
				else if (j==n) {
					minRight=A[i];
				}
				else {
					minRight=Math.min(B[j], A[i]);
				}

				return (maxLeft+minRight)/2.0;
			}
		}
		return 0.0;
	}
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**

```
Time Complexity: O(log(min(m,n)))	At first the searching range is [0,m] and the length of this 
					searching range will be reduced by half after each loop so we
					only need log(m) loops. Since we do constant operations in 
					each loop the time complexity is O(log(m) and since m<=n the
					time complexity is O(log(min(m,n))

Space Complexity: O(1)			We only need constant memory to store 9 local variables so the
					space complexity is O(1)
```

# 5-Longest Palindromic Substring

Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length
of s is 1000. 

```
Example 1: 

Input: "babad" 
Output: "bab" 

Note: "aba" is also a valid answer 
```

```
Example 2: 

Input: "cbbd"
Output: "bb" 
```

<br><br>
<a name="longestPalindromicSubstringLongestCommonSubstring"></a>
## Longest Common Substring

Some people will be tempted to come up with this quick solution which is unforunately flawed, "reverse
S and become S'. Find the longest common substring between S and S' and that will be the longest
palindromic substring." This will work with some examples but there are some cases where the longest
common substring is not a valid palindrome. 

	Ex. S="abacdfgdcaba", S'="abacdgfdcaba" 	

The longest common substring between S and S' is "abacd" and clearly this is not a valid 
	palindrome

We can solve this problem however by checking if the substring's indices are the same as the reversed
substring's original indices each time we find a longest common substring. If it is, then we attempt
to update the longest palindrome found so far, if not we skip this and find the next candidate

**Complexity Analysis**
```
Time Complexity: O(n^2) 
Space Complexity: O(n^2) 
```
<br><br>
<a name="longestPalindromicSubstringBruteForce"></a>
## Brute Force 

The obvious brute force solution is to pick all possible starting and ending position for a substring 
and verify if it is a palindrome 

**Complexity Analysis**
```
Time Complexity: O(n^3)		If n is the length of the input string, there are a total of 
				(n 2) = n(n-1)/2 substrings and since verifying each substring takes 
				O(n) time, the run time complexity is O(n^3)

Space Complexity: O(1) 
```
<br><br>
<a name="longestPalindromicSubstringDynamicProgramming"></a>
## Dynamic Programming 

We can improve on the brute force solution by avoid some unnecessary re-computation while validating 
palidromes. Consider the word "ababa", if we already know that "bab" is a palindrome then we can 
determine that ababa is a palindrome by noticing that the two left and right letters connected to bab
are the same. 

This yields a straight forward dynamic programming solution where we initialize the one and two letters
palindromes and then work our way up finding all three letters palindromes and so on.

Time Complexity: 	O(n^2)	

Space Complexity: 	O(n^2)	Using O(n^2) space to store the table

## Expand Around Center

This approach allows us to solve this problem in O(n^2) time using only constant space complexity. We
observe that a palindrome mirrors around its enter and therefore a palindrome can be expanded from its
center and there are only 2n-1 such centers (for palindromes with an even number of letters like 
"abba" its center is in between two letters).

```java 
public String longestPalindrome(String s) {
	if (s==null || s.length() < 1) return "";     //edge case 
	int start=0, end=0;
	for (int i=0; i<s.length(); i++) {
		int len1=expandAroundCenter(s,i,i);
		int len2=expandAroundCenter(s,i,i+1);
		int len=Math.max(len1,len2);
		if (len>end-start) {
			start= i-(len-1)/2;
			end=i+len/2
		}
	}
	return s.substring(start,end+1);
}

private int expandAroundCenter(String s, int left, int right) {
	int L=left, R=right;
	while(L>=0 && R<s.length() && s.charAt(L)==s.charAt(R)) {
		L--;
		R++;
	}
	return R-L-1;
}

# 6-ZigZag Conversion 

The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: 
```
P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R
```
And then read line by line: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR". Write a code that will take a string and make this 
conversion given a number of rows: 

```
string convert(string s, int numRows);
```

```
Example 1: 

Input: s="PAYPALISHIRING", numRows=3
Output: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"
```

```
Example 2:

Input: s="PAYPALISHIRING", numRows=4
Output: "PINALSIGYAHRPI"

<a name="zigZagConversionSortbyRow"></a>
## Sort by Row 

By iterating through the string from left to right we can easily determine which row in the Zig-Zag
pattern that a character belongs to

<br><br>
*Algorithm*

We can use min(numRows,len(s)) lists to represent the non-empty rows of the Zig-Zag Pattern. 
Iterate through s from left to right appending each character to the appropriate row. The appropriate
row can be tracked using two variables: the current row and the current direction. 

The current direction only changes when we moved to the topmost row or moved down to the bottommost 
row 

```java
class Solution {
	public String convert(String s, int numRows) {
		if (numRows==1) return s;		//if there is only one row return string

		List<StringBuilder> rows=new ArrayList<>();
		for (int i=0; i<Math.min(numRows, s.length()); i++){
			rows.add(new StringBuilder());
		}
		int curRow=0;
		boolean goingDown=false;

		for(char c: s.toCharArray()) {
			rows.get(curRow).append(c);
			if (curRow==0 || curRow==numRows-1) {
				goingDown=!goingDown;
			}
			curRow+=goingDown ? 1 : -1;
		}	

		StringBuilder ret= new StringBuilder();
		for(StringBuilder row:rows) {
			ret.append(row);
		}
		return ret.toString();
	}
}
```

<a name="zigZagConversionVisitbyRow"></a>
## Visit by Row

Visit the characters in the same order as reading the Zig-Zag pattern line by line

<br><br>
*Algorithm*

Visit all characters in row 0 first, then row 1, then row 2, and so on.
For all whole numbers k, 
	* characters in row 0 are located at indexes  k\*(2\*numRows-2)
	* characters in row numRows -1 are located at indexes  k\*(2\*numRows-2)+ numRows -1 
	* characters in inner row i are located at indexes  k\*(2\*numRows-2)+i and (k+1)(2\*numRows-2)-i

```java
class Solution {
	public String convert(String s, int numRows) {
		if (numRows==1) return s; 

		StringBuilder ret=new StringBuilder();
		int n=s.length();
		int cycleLen= 2* numRows -2;

		for (int i=0; i<numRows; i++) {
			for (int j=0; j+1<n; j+= cycleLen) {
				ret.append(s.charAt(j+i));
				if (i!=0 && i!=numROws-1 && j+cycleLen-i<n) {
					ret.append(s.charAt(j+cycleLen-i));
				}
			}
			return ret.toString();
		}
	}
}
```

# 7-Reverse Integer 

Given a 32- bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer. 

```

```
Example 2: 

Input: -123

<br><br>
<a name="reverseIntegerPopandPush"></a>
## Pop and Push Digits and Check Before Overflow 

We can build up the reverse integer one digit at and time and before doing so we can check whether or
not appedning another digit would cause overflow 

<br><br>
*Algorithm*

Reversing an integer can be done similarly to reversing a string. We want to repeatedly "pop" the last
digit off of x and push it to the back of the rev so that in the end rev is the reverse of x. 

To push and pop digits without the help of some auxiliar stack/array we can use math 

```
//pop operation: 
pop = x%10; 
x/=10;

//push operation:
temp=rev*10+pop;
rev =temp;
```

This statement is dangerous however as the statement temp=rev\*10+pop may cause an overflow and luckily
it is easy to check beforehand whether or not this statement would cause an overflow. 

1. If temp=rev\*10+pop causes an overflow, then rev>=INTMAX/10
2. If rev> INTMAX/10, then temp=rev\*10+pop is guaranteed to overflow
3. if rev==INTMAX/10, then temp=rev\*10 + pop will overflow if an only if pop>7

```java
class Solution {
	public int reverse(int x) {
		int rev=0; 
		while (x!=0) {
			int pop=x%10;
			x/=10;
			if (rev>Integer.MAX_VALUE/10||(rev==Integer.MAX_VALUE/10 && pop>7)) return 0;
			if (rev<Integer.MIN_VALUE/10||(rev==Integer.MIN_VALUE/10 && pop<-8)) return 0;
			rev=rev*10 +pop;
		}
		return rev;
	}
}
```

Time Complexity:  O(log(x))	There are roughly log10(x) digits in x 
Space Complexity: O(1)

# 8-String to Integer (atoi)

Implement atoi which converts a string to an integer 

The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace
character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign
followed by as many numerical digits as possible and interprets them as a numerical value. 

The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are 
ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function. 

If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such
sequence exits because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is
performed. 

If no valid conversion could be performed a zero value is returned 

Note: 
* only the space character ' ' is considered as whitespace character 
* assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [-2^31, 2^31-1]. If the numerical value is out of the range of representable values, INT_MAX (2^31-1) or INT_MIN (-2^31) is returned

```
	Example 1: 

	Input: "42"
	Output: 42
```

```
	Example 2: 

	Input: "      -42" 
	Output: -42
```

```
	Example 3:

	Input: "4193 with words "
	Output: 4193
```

```
	Example 4: 
	
	Input: "words and 987"
	Output: 0
```

```
	Example 5:
	
	Input: "-91283472332"
	Output: -2147483648 	//out of the range of a 32-bit signed integer so INT_MIN is returned

<a name="stringtoIntegerASCII"></a>
## ASCII Conversion

Recognize that ASCII characters are actually numbers and 0-9 digits are numbers starting from decimal
48 (0x30 hexadecimal) 

```
	'0' is 48
	'1' is 49
	...
	'9' is 57
```
So to get the value of any character digit you can just remove the '0' 

```
	'1' - '0' => 1
	49  -  48 => 1
```

```java
public int myAtoi(String str) {
	int index=0, sign=1, total=0;
	
	//1. Empty string 
	if (str.length() ==0) return 0;

	//2. Remove Spaces 
	while(str.charAt(index)==' ' && index < str.length())
		index++;
	
	//3. Handle signs 
	if (str.charAt(index)=='+' || str.charAt(index)=='-'){
		sign= str.charAt(index) == '+' ? 1:-1;
		index++;
	}

	//4. COnvert number and avoid overflow
	while(index<str.length()){
		int digit= str.charAt(index) - '0'; 
		if (digit<0||digit>9) break;

		//check if total will overflow after 10 times and add digit
		if (Integer.MAX_VALUE/10 < total || Integer.MAX_VALUE/10 == total

<a name="palindromeNumberRevertHalf"></a>
## Revert Half of the Number

A first idea which may come to mind is to convert the number into a string and check if the string is a
palindrome but this would require extra non-constant space for creating the string not allowed by the 
problem description 

Second idea would be reverting the number itself and comparing the number with the original number, if
they are the same then the number is a palindrome, however if the reversed number is larger than 
int.MAX we will hit integer overflow problem. 

To avoid the overflow issue of the reverted number, what if we only revert half of the int number? The
reverse of the last half of the palindrome should be the same as the first half of the number if the 
number is a palindrome. 

If the input is 1221, if we can revert the last part of the number "1221" from "21" to "12" and compare
it with the first half of the number "12", since 12 is the same as 12, we know that the number is a 
palindrome. 

<br><br>
*Algorithm* 

At the very beginning we can deal with some edge cases. All negative numbers are not palindrome and 
numbers ending in zero can only be a palindrome if the first digit is also 0 (only 0 satisfies this 
property) 

Now let's think about how to revert the last half of the number. For the number 1221 if we do 1221%10 
we get the last digit 1. To get the second last digit we divide the number by 10 1221/10=122 and then
we can get the last digit again by doing a modulus by 10, 122%10=2. If we multiply the last digit by 
10 and add the second last digit 1\*10+2=12 which gives us the reverted number we want. COntinuing this
process would give us the reverted number with more digits. 

Next is how do we know that we've reached the half of the number? 
Since we divided the number by 10 and multiplied the reversed number by 10 when the original number is
less than the reversed number, it means we've gone through half of the number digits. 

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        if (x<0 || (x%10==0 && x!=0)) {
            return false;
        }
        
        int revertedNumber=0;
        while (x>revertedNumber){
            revertedNumber=x%10+revertedNumber*10;
            x/=10;
        }
        //when the length is an odd number, we can get rid of the middle digit by 
        //revertedNumber/10
        
        //For example when the input is 12321, at the end of the while loop we get x=12, 
        //revertedNumber=123, since the middle digit doesn't matter in a palindrome we can
        //simply get rid of it 
        
        return x==revertedNumber||x==revertedNumber/10;
    }
}

<a name="regularExpressionMatching"></a>
# 10-Regular Expression Matching

Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement regular expression matching with support for '.'
and '*'

```
	'.' Matches any single character
	'*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element 
```
The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial) 

Note: 
* s could be empty and contains only lower case letters a-z
* p could be empty and contains only lower case letters a-z and characters like . or * 

```
Example 1: 

Input:
	s="aa" 
	p="a" 
	Output: false 
	Explanation: 	"a" does not match the entire string "aa" 
```

```
Example 2: 

Input: 
	s="aa"
	p="a*" 
	Output: true 
	Explanation: 	'*' means zero of more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating
			'a' once it becomes "aa"
```

```
Example 3: 

Input: 
	s="ab" 
	p=".*" 
	Output: true 
	Explanation: 	'.*' means "zero or more (*) of any character (.)"
```

```
Example 4: 

Input: 
	s="aab" 
	p="c*a*b" 
	Output: true
	Explanation: 	c can be repeated 0 times, a can be repeated 1 time. Therefore it matches 
			"aab" 
```

```
Example 5: 

Input: 
	s="mississippi" 
	p="mis*is*p*."
	Output: false 
```

<br><br>
<a name="regularExpressionMatchingRecursion"></a>
## Recursion

If there were no Kleene stars (the * wildcard characters for regular expressions), the problem would 
be easier- we simply check from left to right if each character of the text matches the pattern. When
a star is present we may need to check for may different suffixes of the text and see if they match
the rest of the pattern. A recursive solution is a straightforward way to represent this relationship

```java
class Solution {
	public boolean isMatch(String text, String pattern) {
		if (pattern.isEmpty()) return text.isEmpty(); 
		
		boolean first_match=(!text.isEmpty() && 
				    (pattern.charAt(0)==text.charAt(0) || pattern.charAt(0)=='.'));

		if (pattern.length()>=2 && pattern.charAt(1) =='*'){
			return (isMatch(text,pattern.substring(2))||
			       (first_match && isMatch(text.substring(1),pattern)));
		
		//note: pattern.substring(2) returns all of the characters after index 2 of pattern
		}
		else {
			return first_match && isMatch(text.substring(1), pattern.substring(1));
		}
		
	}
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**

```
Time Complexity: 	Let T, P be the lengths of the text and the pattern respectively. In the worst
			case, a call to match(text[i:],pattern[2j:]) will be made (i+j i) times, and 
			strings of the order O(T-i) and O(P-2*j) will be made. Thus the complexity has
			the order: 

			summation from i=0 to T * summation from j=0 to P/2 * (i+j i) O(T+P-i-2j).

			We can show that this is bounded by O((T+P)2^(T+P/2))

Space Complexity:	For every call to match, we will create those strings as described above 
			possibly creating duplicates. If memory is not freed, this will also take a
			total of O((T+P)2^(T+P/2)) space even though there are only order O(T^2+P^2) 
			unique suffixes of P and T that are actually required 
```

<br><br>
<a name="regularExpressionMatchingDynamicProgramming"></a>
## Dynamic Programming

As the problem has an optimal substructure, it is natural to cache intermediate results. We ask the 
question dp(i,j): does text[i:] and pattern[j:] match? We can describe our answer in terms of answers
to questions involving smaller strings

<br><br>
*Algorithm* 

We proceed with the same recursion as in Approach 1, except because calls will only ever be made to 
match(text[i:], pattern[j:]), we use dp(i,j) to handle those calls instead, saving us expensive 
string-building operations and allowing us to cache the intermediate results 


**Java Top-Down Variation**

```java
enum Result {
	TRUE, FALSE
	
}

class Solution {
	Result[][] memo; 

	public boolean isMatch(String text, String pattern) { 
		memo=new Result[text.length() +1][pattern.length() +1];
		return dp(0,0,text,pattern);
	}

	public boolean dp(int i, int j, String text, String pattern) {
		if (memo[i][j]!=null) {
			return memo[i][j]==Result.TRUE;
		}
		boolean ans; 
		if (j==pattern.length()){
			ans=i==text.length();
		}
		else {
			boolean first_match=(i<text.length() && (pattern.charAt(j) == text.charAt(i) ||
					     patter.charAt(j) == '.'));

			if (j+1<pattern.length() && pattern.charAt(j+1)=='*'){
				ans=(dp(i,j+1,text,pattern)||first_match&& dp(i+1,j,text,pattern));
			}
			else {
				ans=first_match && dp(i+1, j+1, text, pattern); 
			}
		}
		memo[i][j]=ans? Result.TRUE: Result.FALSE; 
		return ans; 
	}
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**

```
Time Complexity: 	Let T, P be the lengths of the text and the pattern respectively. The work 
			for every call to dp(i,j) for i=0,...,T; j=0,...,P is done once and it is O(1) 				work. Hence the time complexity is O(TP)

Space Complexity:	The only memory we use is the O(TP) boolean entries in our cache. Hence, the 
			space complexity is O(TP) 
```

<br><br>
<a name="regularExpressionMatchingNonRecursive"></a>
## Non-Recursive

The recursive programming solutions are pretty confusing so this implementation uses 2D arrays and 
Dynamic Programming 


The logic works as follows: 
```
1. If p.charAt(j) == s.charAt(i) : dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]; 
2. If p.charAt(j) == '.' : dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]; 
3. If p.charAt(j) == '*': 
	
	Subconditions
	1. If p.charAt(j-1)!= s.charAt(i):dp[i][j]=dp[i][j-2]  	//in this case a* only counts as empty
	2. If p.charAt(i-1)== s.charAt(i) or p.charAt(i-1) == '.': 
		
		dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]	//in this case a* counts as multiple a 
	     or dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1]	//in this case a* counts as single a 
	     or dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-2]	//in this case a* counts as empty 
```

```java
public boolean isMatch(String s, String p) {
	if (s==null || p==null){
		return false;
	}
	boolean[][] dp=new boolean[s.length()+1][p.length()+1];
	dp[0][0]=true; 
	for (int i=0;i<p.length(); i++){
		if (p.charAt(i)=='*' && dp[0][i-1]){
			dp[0][i+1]=true;

# 11-Container with the Most Water 

Given n non negative integers a1,a2, ... , an where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n 
vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two 
lines, which together with x-axis forns a container such that the container contains the most water. 

```Example: The array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7] would have a max area of water which is 49. 

		      ^		    ^
	 These two values form the container which could hold water at a max height of 7, these values
	 are also 7 array indexes apart from each other so it could hold water at a max width of 7. The
	 area of water which could be held is thus 7 x 7 = 49
```


<a name="containerwiththeMostWaterBruteForce"></a>
## Brute Force

In this case we simply consider the area for every possible pair of the lines and find out the maximum
area out of those. 

```

	public int maxArea(int[] height) {
		int maxarea=0; 
		for (int i=0; i<height.length; i++){
			for (int j=i+1;j<height.length;j++){
				maxarea=Math.max(maxarea, Math.min(height[i],height[j])*(j-i));
			}
		}
		return maxarea;
	}
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**
```
Time complexity: 	O(n^2) 	Calculating the area for all n(n-1)/2 height pairs 
Space complexity: 	O(1) 	Constant extra space is used 
```

<br><br>
<a name="containerwiththeMostWaterTwoPointer"></a>
## Two Pointer Approach

The intuition behind this approach is that the area formed between the lines will always be limited by 
the height of the shorter line. Further, the farther the lines, the more will be the area obtained. 

We take two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end of the array constituting the length of 
the lines. Further, we maintain a variable maxarea to store the maximum area obtained till now. At 
every step, we find out the area formed between them, update maxarea and move the pointer pointing to 
the shorter line towards the other end by one step. 

Initially we consider the area constituting the exterior most lines. Now to maximize the area we need
to consider the area between the lines of larger lengths. If we try to move the pointer at the longer
line inwards, we won't gain any increase in area, since it is limited by the shorter line. But moving
the shorter line's pointer could turn out to be benefical, as per the same argument, despite the 
reduction in width. This is done since a relatively longer line obtained by moving the shorter line's 
pointer might overcome the reduction in area caused by the width reduction. 

```java
public class Solution {
	public int maxArea(int[] height) {
		int maxarea=0, l=0, r=height.length-1; 
		while (l<r){
			maxarea=Math.max(maxarea,Math.min(height[l],height[r])*(r-l));
			if (height[l]<height[r]){
				l++;
			}
			else{
				r--;
			}
		}
		return maxarea; 
	}
}
```

For example, two is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. Twelve is written as
XII which is simply X + II. The number twenty seven is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II. 

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for 
four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we 
subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine which is written as IX. There 
are six instances where subtraction is used: 

* I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9 
* X can be placed before L (50) and C(100) to make 40 and 90 
* C can be placed before D (500) and M(1000) to make 400 and 900

Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral, input is guaranteed to be within the range from 
1 to 3999

# 14-Longest Common Prefix

Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings. If there is no 
common prefix, return an empty string ""

```
Example 1: 

Input: ["flower", "flow", "flight"]
Output: "fl"
```

```
Example 2: 

Input: ["dog", "racecar", "car"] 
Output: ""

Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings 
```

*Note:* 
All given inputs are in lowercase letters a-z

<br><br>
<a name="longestCommonPrefixHorizontalScanning"></a>
## Horizontal Scanning

<br>
*Intuition:* 

For a start we will describe a simple way of find the longest prefix shared by a set of strings 
LCP(S1 ... Sn).We will use the observation that: 
```
LCP(S1 ... Sn) = LCP(LCP(LCP(S1, S2), S3), ... Sn) 
```

<br><br>
*Algorithm:*

To employ this idea, the algorithm iterates through the strings [S1 ... Sn]. finding at each iteration
i the longest common prefix of strings LCP(S1 ... Si). When LCP(S1 ... Si) is an empty string, the 
algorithm ends. Otherwise after n iterations, the algorithm returns LCP(S1 ... Sn) 

```

Example: 

{leets, leetcode, leet, leeds}
   \       /      
  LCP{1,2} = leets
  	     leetcode
	     leet 

	 	\	{leets, leetcode, leet, leeds}
		 \ 			   /

		 LCP{1,3} = leet
		 	    leet
			    leet

			      \          {leets, leetcode, leet, leeds}
			       \ 				  /
			       LCP{1,4}   leet
			       		  leeds
					  lee

				LCP{1,4} = "lee"
```

```java
public String longestCommon Prefix(String[] strs){
	if (strs.length==0){
		return ""; 
	}
	String prefix=strs[0]; 
	for (int i=1; i<strs.length; i++) {
		while (strs[i].indexOf(prefix) != 0) {
			prefix=prefix.substring(0, prefix.length() -1);
			if (prefix.isEmpty()) {
				return "";
			}
		}
		return prefix; 
	}
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**
```
Time complexity: 	O(S)	Where S is the sum of all characters in all strings. In the worse case
				all n strings are the same. The algorithm compares the string S1 with 
				the other strings [S2 ... Sn]. There are S character comparisons where
				S is the sum of all characters in the input array 

Space complexity: 	O(1) 	We only used constant extra space 
```


<br><br>
<a name="longestCommonPrefixVerticalScanning"></a>
## Vertical Scanning

Imagine a very short string is at the end of the array. The above approach will still do S comparisons.
One way to optimize this case is to do vertical scanning. We compare characters from top to bottom on
the same column (same character index of the strings) before moving on to the next column. 


```java
public String longestCommonPrefix(String[] strs) {
	if (strs==null || strs.length==) return ""; 
	for (int i=0; i<strs[0].length(); i++){
		char c=strs[0].charAt(i); 
		for (int j=1; j<strs.length; j++) {
			if (i==strs[j].length() || strs[j].charAt(i)!=c){
				return strs[0].substring(0,i);
			}
		}
	}
	return strs[0]; 
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**

```
Time complexity: 	O(S) 	Where S is the sum of all characters in all strings. In the worst case
				there will be n equal strings with length m and the algorithm performs
				S=n*m character comparisons. Even the worst case is still the same as 
				Approach 1, in the best case there are at most n*minLen comparisons 
				where minLen is the length of the shortest string in the array. 

Space complexity: 	O(1)	We only used constant extra space
```

<br><br>
<a name="longestCommonPrefixDivideandConquer"></a>
## Divide and Conquer

The idea of the algorithm comes from the associative property of LCP operation. We notice that: 
LCP(S1 ... Sn) = LCP(LCP(S1 ... Sk), LCP(Sk+1 ... Sn)), where LCP(S1 ... Sn) is the longest common
prefix in a set of strings [S1 ... Sn], 1<k<n 

<br><br>
*Algorithm* 

To apply the previous observation, we use the divide and conquer technique, where we split the 
LCP(Si ... Sj) problem into two subproblems LCP(Si ... Smid) and LCP(Smid+1 ... Sj), where mid is 
(i+j)/2. We use their solutions lcpLeft and lcpRight to construct the solution of the main problem 
LCP(Si ... Sj). To accomplish this we compare one by one the characters of lcpLeft and lcpRight till 
there is no character match. The found common prefix of lcpLeft and lcpRight is the solution of the 
LCP(Si ... Sj) 


```
				{leetcode, leet, lee, le} 

				    /                \   
Divide 			{leetcode, leet}            {lee, le} 

Conquer				|			 | 

			     {leet} 		        {le} 

			         \                      /

				 	   {le} 

	Searching for the longest common prefix (LCP) in dataset {leetcode, leet, lee, le} 
```

```java
public String longestCommonPrefix(String[] strs) { 

	if (strs == null || strs.length ==0) return "";
		return longestCommonPrefix(strs, 0, strs.length-1); 

}

private String longestCommonPrefix(String[] strs, int l, int r) { 
	if (l==r) {
		return strs[l];
	}
	else {
		int mid=(l+r)/2; 
		String lcpLeft= longestCommonPrefix(strs,l, mid); 
		String lcpRight= longestCommonPrefix(strs,mid+1;r); 
		return commonPrefix(lcpLeft,lcpRight);
	}
}

String commonPrefix(String left, String right) {
	int min=Math.min(left.length(), right.length()); 
	for (int i=0; i<min; i++) {
		if (left.charAt(i) !=right.charAt(i) ){
			return left.substring(0, i);
		}
	}
	return left.substring(0, min);
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**

In the worst case we have n equal strings with length m

```
Time Complexity: O(S)		where S is the number of all characters in the array, S=m*n so time
				complexity is 2*T(n/2)+O(m). Therefore time complexity is O(S). In the
				best case the algorithm performs O(minLen * n) comparisons, where
				minLen is the shortest string of the array 

Space Complexity: O(m*log(n))	There is a memory overhead since we sotre recursive call in the 
				execution stack. There are log(n) recursive calls, each store needs m
				space to store the result so space complexity is O(m*log(n))
```

<br><br>
<a name="longestCommonPrefixBinarySearch"></a>
## Binary Search

The idea is to apply binary search method to find the string with maximum value L, which is common 
prefix of all the strings. The algorithm searches the space in the interval (0 ... minLen), where 
minLen is minimum string length and the maximum possible common prefix. Each time search space is 
divided in two equal parts, one of them is discarded because it is sure that it doesn't contain the 
solution. There are two possible cases: 

* S[1...mid] is not a common string. This means that for each j>i, S[1...j] is not a common string and we discard the second half of the search space
* S [1...mid] is common string. This means that for each i<j, S[1...i] is a common string and we discard the first half of the search space, because we try to find longer common prefix

```

**Complexity Analysis

In the worst case we have n equal strings with length m 

```
	Time complexity: 	O(S * log(n)), where S is the sum of all characters in all strings. The

				comparisons, which gives in total O(S * log(n)) time complexity

	Space complexity: 	O(1). We only used constant extra space

<a name="longestCommonPrefixFurtherThoughts"></a>
## Further Thoughts 

Considering a slightly different problem: 
```
	Given a set of keys S= [S1, S2 ... Sn], find the longest common prefix among a string q and S.
	This LCP query will be called frequently
```
We coule optimize LCP queries by storing the set of keys S in a Trie. See this for Trie 
implementation. In a Trie, each node descending from the root represents a common prefix of some keys. But we need to 
find the longest common prefix of a string q and all key strings. This means that we have to find the
deepest path from the root, which satisfies the following conditions 

* it is a prefix of query string q
* each node along the path must contain only one child element. Otherwise the found path will not be a
  common prefix among all strings
* the path doesn't comprise of nodes which are marked as end of key. Otherwise the path couldn't be a
  prefix of a key which is shorter than itself

<br><br>
*Algorithm* 

The only question left is how to find the deepest path in the Trie, that fulfills the requirements 
above. The most effective way is to build a trie from {S1 ... Sn] strings. Then find the prefix of 
query string q in the Trie. We traverse the Trie from the root, till it is impossible to continue the
path in the Trie because one of the conditions above is not satisfied. 


```
Searching for the longest common prefix of string "le" in a Trie from dataset {lead, leet}

			Root

			 1

	l   ===========>  \  l

			     2

	e   ===============>   \ e

LCP "le" FOUND	=============>   3   

			     a	/  \ e    End of Key "lee" 
				     
			      6      4

			 d  /	       \ t
				        
END OF KEY "lead"	  7		 5   End of key "leet"

                return prefix.toString();

         }
         return prefix.toString();
    }
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**
```
In the worst case query q has length m and is equal to all n strings of the array 

Time Complexity:   O(S)   where S is the number of all characters in the array, LCP query O(m) 
  			  Trie build has O(S) time complexity. To find the common prefix of q

Space complexity:  O(S)   we only used additional S extra space for the Trie.

## Sorted Array


The method is to sort an input array and then run through all indices of a possible first element of a

to skip elements to avoid duplicates in the answer without expending extra memory. 

```

    //Arrays.sort re-arranges the array of integers in ascending order
    //ex. [1, 2, 3, 4]

    Arrays.sort(num);
    List<List<Integer>> res = new LinkedList<>(); 
    for (int i = 0; i < num.length-2; i++) {
        if (i == 0 || (i > 0 && num[i] != num[i-1])) {
            
	    //This lets us skip some of the duplicate entries in the array
	    
	    int lo = i+1, hi = num.length-1, sum = 0 - num[i];

	    //This is for the 2 Sum sweep 

            while (lo < hi) {
                if (num[lo] + num[hi] == sum) {
                    res.add(Arrays.asList(num[i], num[lo], num[hi]));
                    while (lo < hi && num[lo] == num[lo+1]) lo++;
                    while (lo < hi && num[hi] == num[hi-1]) hi--;

		    //This lets us skip some of the duplicate entries in the array

                    lo++; hi--;
                } else if (num[lo] + num[hi] < sum) lo++;
                else hi--;

		//This allows us to optimize slightly since we know that the array is sorted
           }
        }
    }
    return res;
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**
```
Time Complexity:  O(n^2)   We go through a maximum of n elements for the first element of a triplet, 
			   and then when making a bi-directional 2Sum sweep of the remaining part of 
			   the array we also go through a maxiumum of n elements. 

Space Complexity: O(1)	   If we assume the return linked list is not extra space, then we do not 
			   allocate any significant extra space

Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum

exactly one solution.

<a name="threeSumClosestThreePointers"></a>
## 3 Pointers

Similar to the previous 3Sum problem, we use three pointers to point to the current element, next 
element and the last element. If the sum is less than the target, it means that we need to add a larger
element so next element move to the next. If the sum is greater, it means we have to add a smaller 
element so last element move to the second last element. Keep doing this until the end. Each time 
compare the difference between sum and target, if it is less than minimum difference so far, then 
replace result with it, otherwise continue iterating. 

```
public class Solution {
		public int threeSumClosest(int[] num, int target) {
		int result=num[0] + num[1] + num[num.length-1];

## Backtracking 


Backtracking is an algorithm for finding all solutions by exploring all potential candidates. If the 
solution candidate turns to not be a solution (or at least not the last one), backtracking algorithm 
discards it by making some changes on the previous step, ie *backtracks* and then tries again. 

Here is a backtrack function backtrack(combination, next_digits) which takes as arguments an ongoing 
letter combination and the next digits to check. 

- If there are no more digits to check that means the current combination is done 
- If there are still digits to check: 
	- Iterate over the letters mapping to the next available digit
	- Append the current letter to the current combination and proceed to check next digits:

# 18-4Sum

Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target, are there elements a, b, c, and d in nums such
that a + b + c + d = target? Find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the sum of target



*Note:*
The solution set must not contain duplicate quadruplets 


```
Example: 


Given array nums = [1, 0, -1, 0, -2, 2], and target = 0


A solution set is:

# 19-Remove Nth Node From End of List 

Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of the list and return its head

```
Example: 

Given linked list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, and n=2 


After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 
		   
		   1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5

**Follow up:**
Could you do this in one pass?

<a name="removeNthNodefromEndofListTwoPassAlgorithm"></a>
## Two Pass Algorithm


**Intuition**

We notice that the problem could be simply reduced to another one: Remove the (L-n+1)th node from the
beginning of the list, where L is the list length. This problem is easy to solve once we found the 
list length L. 





<br><br>
**Algorithm** 

First we will add an auxiliary "dummy" node, which points to the list head. The "dummy" node is used to
simplify some corner cases such as a list with only one node or removing the head of the list. On the 
first pass, find the list length L. Then we set a pointer to the dummy node and start to move it 
through the list till it comes to the (L-n)th node. We relink next pointer of the (L-n)th node to the
(L-n+2)th node and we are done. 


```
	D -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> NULL

		    |
		    v

	D -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> NULL
```



```java 
public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
	
	ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0); 
	dummy.next = head; 
	int length =0; 
	ListNode first = head; 
	
	while (first!=null) {
		
		length++;
		first=first.next;
	}

	length -= n; 
	first = dummy;
	while (length>0) {
		
		length--;
		first=first.next;
	}
	first.next=first.next.next;
	return dummy.next; 
}
```

**Complexity Analysis** 
```
Time Complexity: 	O(L) 	The algorithm makes two traversals of the list, first to calculate the 
				list length L and second to find the (L-n)th node. There are 2L-n 
				operations and time complexity is O(L)

Space Complexity: 	O(1) 	We only used constant extra space
```





<br><br>
<a name="removeNthNodefromEndofListOnePassAlgorithm"></a>
## One Pass Algorithm

The previous algorithm could be optimized to one pass. Instead of one pointer, we could use two 
pointers. The first pointer advances the list by n+1 steps from the beginning, while the second pointer
starts from the beginning of the list. Now, both pointers are separated by exactly n nodes. We maintain
this constant gap by advancing both pointers together until the first pointer arrives past the last 
node. The second pointer will be pointing at the nth node counting from the last. We relink the next
pointer of the node referenced by the second pointer to point to the node's next next node. 



```
Maintaining N=2 nodes apart between the first and second pointer 

	D	-> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> NULL

       first 	 Head 
       second 

			   


Move the first pointer N+1 steps 


			     |
			     v


	D	-> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> NULL

      second     Head       First


Move the first and second pointers together until the first pointer arrives past the last node 


			     |
			     v


	D	-> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> NULL
		
		 Head      Second           First

Second pointer points to the nth node counting from last so link node to the node's next next node 



				  |
				  v


	D	-> 1 -> 2 -> 3 ->   -> 5 -> NULL
	         
		 Head      Second           First
```


```java 
public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
	
	ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
	dummy.next = head; 
	ListNode first = dummy; 
	ListNode second = dummy;
	
	//Moves the first pointer so that the first and second nodes are separated by n nodes
	
	for (int i=1; i<=n+1; i++) {
		
		first = first.next;
	}

	//Move first to the end, maintaining the gap

	while (first!=null) {

		first=first.next;
		second=second.next;
	}

	second.next=second.next.next;
	return dummy.next;
}
```



**Complexity Analysis** 

```
Time Complexity: 	O(L) 	The algorithm makes one traversal of the list of L nodes. Therefore
				time complexity is O(L)

Space Complexity: 	O(1)	Only constant extra space was used

<a name="validParenthesesCounting"></a>
## Counting method



**Intuition** 

Imagine you are writing a small compiler for your college project and one of the tasks or sub-tasks for
the compiler would be to detect if the parenthesis are in place or not. 



The algorithm we will look at in this article can be then used to process all the parenthesis in the 
program your compiler is compiling and checking if all the parenthesis are in place. This makes 
checking if a given string of parenthesis is valid or not, an important programming problem. 



The expressions that we will deal with in this problem can consist of three different types of 
parenthesis: 


- () 
- {}
- []


Before looking at how we can check if a given expression consisting of thes parenthesis is valid or 
not, let us look at a simpler version of the problem that consists of just one type of parenthesis. So,
the expressions we can encounter in this simplified version of the problem are: 


```
(((((()))))) -- VALID

()()()()     -- VALID

(((((((()    -- INVALID

((()(())))   -- VALID
```


Let's look at a simple algorithm to deal with this problem 

<br><br>

1. We process the expression one bracket at a time starting from the left 
2. Suppose we encounter an opening bracket ie. `(`, it may or may not be an invalid expression because
   there can be a matching ending bracket somewhere in the remaining part of the expression. Here, we 
   simply increment the counter keeping track of the left parenthesis till now. `left += 1`
3. If we encounter a closing bracket, this has two meanings: 
   
   - There was no matching opening bracket for this closing bracket and in that case we have an invalid
     expression. This is the case when `left==0` ie. when there are no unmatched left brackets 
     available
   
   - We had some unmatched opening bracket available to match this closing bracket. This is the case 
     when `left>0` ie. we have unmatched left brackets available 

4. If we encounter a closing bracket ie. `)` when left==0, then we have an invalid expression on our 
   hands. Else, we decrement `left` thus reducing the number of unmatched left parenthesis available.
5. Continue processing the string until all parenthesis have been processed
6. If in the end we still have an unmatched left parenthesis available, this implies an invalid 
   expression 

<br><br>

The reason we discussed this particular algorithm here is because the approach for the approach for 
the original problem derives its inspiration from this very solution. 


If we try and follow the same approach for our original problem, then it simply won't work. The reason
a simple counter based approach works above is because all the parenthesis are of the same type. So 
when we encounter a closing bracket, we simply assume a corresponding opening matching bracket 
to be available ie. if `left>0`


But in our problem, if we encounter say `]`, we don't really know if there is a corresponding opening
`[` available or not. You could say: 

> Why not maintain a separate counter for the different types of parenthesis?

This doesn't work because the relative placement of the parenthesis also matters here eg: `[{]`

<br><br> 

If we simply keep counters here, then as soon as we encounter the closing square bracket, we would 
know there is an unmatched opening square bracket available as well. But, the **closest unmatched 
opening bracket available is a curly bracket and not a square bracket and hence the counting approach
breaks here. 







<br><br>
<a name="validParenthesesStack"></a>
## Stacks 

An interesting property about a valid parenthesis expression is that a sub-expression. (Not every 
sub-expression) eg. 

```
	{ [ [ ] { } ] } ( ) ( ) 

	  ^         ^
	  |         |
```

The entire expression is valid, but sub portions of it are also valid in themselves. This lends a sort 
of a recursive structure to the problem. For example consider the expression enclosed within the 
marked parenthesis in the diagram above. The opening bracket is at index `1` and the corresponding 
closing bracket is at index `6`. 


> What if whenever we encounter a matching pair of parenthesis in the expression we simply remove it
> from the expression? 


Let's have a look at this idea below where we remove the smaller expressions one at a time from the 
overall expression and since this is a valid expression, we would be left with an empty string in the
end. 


```
The stack data structure can come in handy here in representing this recursive structure of the 
problem. We can't really process this from the inside out because we don't have an idea about the 
overall structure. But, the stack can help us process this recursively ie. from outside to inwards.
```

Lets take a look at the algorithm for this problem using stacks as the intermediate data structure. 


**Algorithm** 

1. Initialize a stack S. 
2. Process each bracket of the expression one at a time 
3. If we encounter an opening bracket, we simply push it onto the stack. This means we will process it
   later, let us simply move onto the sub-expression ahead 
4. If encounter a closing bracket, then we check the element on top of the stack. If the element at the
   top of the stack is an opening bracket `of the same type`, then we pop it off the stack and continue
   processing. Else, this implies an invalid expression 
5. In the end, if we are left with a stack still having elements, then this implies an invalid 
   expression

Lets take a look at the implementation for this algorithm



```java 
class Solution {
	
	//Hash table that takes care of the mappings
	private HashMap<Character, Character> mappings; 

	//Initialize the hash map with mappings. This simply makes the code easier to read 
	public Solution() {
		
		this.mappings = new HashMap<Character, Character>(); 
		this.mappings.put(')', '(');
		this.mappings.put('}', '{');
		this.mappings.put(']', '[');
	}

	public boolean isValid(String s) { 
		
		// Initialize a stack to be used in the algorithm
		Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<Character>();

		for (int i=0; i< s.length(); i++) {
			
			char c = s.charAt(i);

			// If the current character is a closing bracket 

			if (this.mappings.containsKey(c)) {
				
				// Get the top element of the stack. If the stack is empty, set a dummy value of '#' 
				char topElement = stack.empty() ? '#' : stack.pop();

				// If the mapping for this bracket doesn't match the stack's top element, return false. 
				if (topElement != this.mappings.get(c)) {
					return false;
				}
			} else {
				
				//If it was an opening bracket, push to the stack  
				
				stack.push(c);
			}
		}

		//If the stack still contains elements, then it is an invalid expression. 
		return stack.isEmpty();
	}
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**

```
Time Complexity: 	O(n)	We simply traverse the given string one character at a time and push 
				and pop operations on a stack take O(1) time 

Space Complexity: 	O(n)	In the worst case, when we push all opening brackets onto the stack, we
				will end up pushing all the brackets onto the stack eg (((((((((((

<a name="mergeTwoSortedListsNonRecursive"></a>
## Non-Recursive 

Similar approach and implemenation to the recursive solution above but a little more intuitive and 
does not require memory being held on the stack (as the recursive program runs it has to store 
variables on the stack so that when the program jumps back it is able to continue) 


As with most other linked list solutions, a dummy node is utilized and two pointers are used to keep
track of where we are in the the two linked lists. 

```java 
class solution {
	public ListNode mergeTwoLists(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
		
		ListNode returnNode = new ListNode(-1); 
		ListNode headNode = returnNode; 
		
		while (l1 != null && l2 != null) {
			if (l1.val <= l2.val) {
				returnNode.next = l1;
				l1 = l1.next;
			} else {
				returnNode.next = l2;
				l2 = l2.next;

			returnNode = returnNode.next;

		if (l1 == null) {
			returnNode.next = l2;

<a name="generateParenthesesBruteForce"></a>
## Brute Force 

**Intuition** 

We can generate all 2^(2n) sequences of `(` and `)` characters. Then we can check if each one is valid

<br>

**Algorithm** 

To generate all sequences, we use recursion. All sequences of length `n` is just `(` plus all sequences
of length `n-1`, and then `)` plus all sequences of length `n-1`. 

To check whether a sequence is valid, we keep track of `balance`, the net number of opening brackets 
minuts closing brackets. If it falls below zero at any time, or doesn't end in zero, the sequence is 
invalid - otherwise it is valid. 


```java 
class Solution {
	
	public List<String> generateParenthesis(int n) {
		
		List<String> combinations = new ArrayList(); 
		generateAll(new char[2*n], 0, combinations);
		return combinations;
	}

	public void generateAll(char[] current, int pos, List<String> result) {
		
		if(pos == current.length) {
			
			if (valid(current)) {
				result.add(new String(current));
			} 

		} else {
			current[pos] = '(';
			generateAll(current, pos+1, result);
			current[pos] = ')';
			generateAll(current, pos+1, result);
		
		}
	}

	public boolean valid(char[] current) {
		
		int balance = 0; 
		for (char c : current) {
			
			if(c == '(') {
				balance++;
			} else {
				balance--;
			}

			if(balance < 0) {
				return false; 
			}
		}
		return (balance == 0);
	}
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**

```
Time Complexity: 	O(2^2n * n)	For each of 2^2n sequences, we need to create an validate the 
					sequence, which takes O(n) work in the worst case 

Space Complexity: 	O(2^2n * n) 	Naively, every sequence could be valid, see Closure number for
					a tighter asymptotic bound 
```




<br><br>
<a name="generateParenthesesBacktracking"></a>
## Backtracking


**Intuition and Algorithm** 

Instead of adding `(` or `)` every time as we do in the Brute Force algorithm, let's only add them 
when we know it will remain a valid sequence. We can do this by keeping track of the number of opening
and closing brackets we have placed so far. 

We can start an opening bracket if we still have one (of `n`) left to place. And we can start a closing
bracket if it would not exceed the number of opening brackets 


```java 
class Solution {
	
	public List<String> generateParenthesis(int n) {
		
		List<String> ans = new ArrayList(); 
		backtrack(ans, "", 0, 0, n);
		return ans; 
	}

	public void backtrack(List<String> ans, String cur, int open, int close, int max){
		
		if (cur.length() == max*2) {
			ans.add(cur);
			return;
		}

		if(open < max) {
			backtrack(ans, cur + "(", open + 1, close, max);
		} 
		
		if (close < open) {
			backtrack(ans, cur + ")", open, close +1, max);
		}
	}
}
```

**Complexity Analysis** 

Our complexity analysis rests on understanding how many elements there are in `generateParenthesis(n)`.
This analysis is outside the scope of this article, but it turns out this is the nth Catalan number 
1/(n+1) (2n choose n), which is bounded asymptotically by 4^n/(n* sqrt(n)). 

```
Time Complexity: 	O((4^n)/sqrt(n))	Each valid sequence has at most n steps during the 
						backtracking procedure

Space Complexity: 	O((4^n)/sqrt(n))	As described above and using O(n) space to store the
						sequence
```

Another way to think about the runtime of backtracking algorithms on interviewers is O(b^d), where b is
the branching factor and d is the maximum depth of recursion. 

Backtracking is characterized by a number of decisions b that can be made at each level of recursion. 
If you visualize the recursion tree, this is the number of children each internal node has. You can
also think of b as standing for "base", which helps us remember that b is the base of the exponential.

If we make b decisions at each level of recursion, and we expand the recursion tree to d levels (ie. 
each path has a length of d), then we get b^d nodes. Since backtracking is exhaustive and must visit 
each of these nodes, the runtime is O(b^d)








<br><br>
<a name="generateParenthesesClosureNumber"></a>
## Closure Number



To enumerate something, generally we would like to express it as a sum of disjoint subsets that are 
easier to count. 


Consider the *closure number* of a valid parentheses sequence `s`: the least `index >= 0` so that 
`S[0], S[1], ... , S[2 * index + 1] is valid. Clearly, every parentheses sequence has a unique closure
number. We can try to enumerate them individually. 


<br><br>

**Algorithm** 

For each closure number c, we know the starting and ending brackets must be at index `0` and 
`2 * c + 1`. Then, the `2 * c` elements between must be a valid sequence, plus the rest of the elements
must be a valid sequence.



This is just some minor improvement to the backtracking solution using the fact that for all valid 
solutions the first char is always '(' and the lat char is always ')'. We initialize the starting 
string to '(' and set the recursion bottom condition to string reaching length of `2 * n - 1` - we know
that we need to append a bracket at the end. There will not be much of an improvement in the runtime
however. 


```java 
class Solution {
	public List<String> generateParenthesis(int n) {
		List<String> ans = new ArrayList(); 
		if (n==0) {
			ans.add("");
		} else {
			for (int c=0; c<n; ++c)
				for (String left: generateParenthesis(c))
					for (String right: generateParenthesis(n-1-c))
						ans.add("(" + left + ")" + right);
		}
		return ans;

## Brute Force 


**Intuition and Algorithm** 

* Traverse all the linked lists and collect the values of the nodes into an array
* Sort and iterate over this array to get the proper value of nodes
* Create a new sorted linked list and extend it with the new nodes 

As for sorting you can refer to the Algorithms/Data Structures CheatSheet for more about sorting algorithms.

# 146-LRU Cache 

Design and implement a data structure for Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. It should support the following operations: `get` and `put`. 

`get(key)` - Get the value (will always be positive) of the key if the key exists in the cache, otherwise return `-1` 

`put(key, value)` - Set or insert the value if the key is not already present. When the cache reached its capacity, it should invalidate the least recently used item before inserting a new item. 

**Follow up:**
Could both of these operations be done in **O(1)** time complexity?

**Example:**
```
LRUCache cache = new LRUCache(2 /* capacity */);

cache.put(1, 1);
cache.put(2, 2);
cache.get(1); 			// returns 1 
cache.put(3, 3); 		// evicts key 2
cache.get(2);			// returns -1 (not found)
	
```

### [House Robber](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber)<a name="house-robber"></a>
```java
/*
The basic idea is that if you are robbing house i, the maximum loot may come from by robbing the i-2th house or by robbing the i-3th house. Therefore rob both and then find the path that gave the maximum profit.
Example: loot = [1,9,3,8,4,3,6,4,3,5,7,6]
Profit DP = [1,9,4,17,13,20,23,24,26,29,33,35]
Here,

	dp[4] = loot[4] + max(dp[2], dp[1])
	dp[5] = loot[5] + max(dp[3], dp[2]) and so on.
In the end, just compare the last two elements to check which path gave us the maximum profit.
Some people might not prefer modifying the original nums array. In that case, you can initialize another dp array of same length, initialize the first two elements as dp[0] = nums[0] and dp[1] = nums[1] and dp[3] = nums[0] + nums[2] and then performing the same loop. In that case, you would be using O(n) space.

### [kth Largest Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/)<a name="kth-largest-element"></a>
1.	The minheap algorithm has $O(n lg n) $ complexity and $O(1)$ space. The idea here is that we use a minheap to keep only the k greatest elements. If size becomes more than k, we remove the smallest element at the top of the heap. Thereby, at the end, our kth largest element will be at the top.
2.	QuickSelect Algorithm performs in $O(n)$ best case, $O(n^2)$ worst case when the pivot chosen is always the largest, so we use a random pivot.

Start from the beginning of the array, maintain the last position of non-zero value you saw, and the current element. If you see a non-zero value, swap the current value with the index just after the last non-zero index you have, and then increment the non-zero index by 1 because you just found a new non-zero value. This helps us prepare for the next non-zero value we find and copy it at this index+1. By doing so, we are basically partitioning the array into non-zeroes and zero values.

### [Arranging Coins](https://leetcode.com/problems/arranging-coins/)<a name="arranging-coins"></a>
The idea is as follows. Sum of first n numbers is given by $\frac{n^2+n}{2}$. We need to find $n$ such that sum of $n$ numbers is closest to the number of coins we have. That is, $\frac{n^2+n}{2} = k$ where $k$ is the number of coins we have. So, everything boils down to solving the quadratic equation $n^2 + n - 2k = 0$. We use the quadratic formula where for any quadratic equation $ax^2 -bx + c$ is solved substituting for $a$, $b$ and $c$ in $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2}$. Here, $a$ and $b$ are always going to be 1, while $c$ is always going to be $2k$. Substitute those, and solve the equation.

```java
public int arrangeCoins(int n) {
    // return solveQuadratic(n);
    return iterative(n);
}

private int solveQuadratic(int n){
    return (int)(Math.sqrt(1 + 8*(long)n)-1)/2;

            ++level;				// we were able to fill the level.

```java
/**
The idea is simple. For each number in the array, since it's gauranteed that that the values
lie are inclusive [1,n], we can look at the index value-1. So check that index, and mark
that value as negative. That is why I take the absolute value. Check value at that index, if
negative, it means we have visited it via some other duplicate value. But if it's positive,
then we are seeing it for the first time, so make it's value negative. Make a second pass.
For values that are still positive, that means those indices were never visited, hence left
positive. So add 1 to them and add it to the set. Eg:
	Given array a = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1],
1.	val = 4 => idx = 3 & a[3] > 0, therefore, a[3] *= -1
	a = [4,3,2,-7,8,2,3,1]
2.	val = 3 => idx = 2 & a[2] > 0, therefore a[2] *= -1
	a = [4,3,-2,-7,8,2,3,1]
3.	val = -2 => idx = abs(-2)-1 = 1 & a[1] > 0, therefore a[1] *= -1
	a = [4,-3,-2,-7,8,2,3,1]
4.	val = -7 => idx = abs(-7)-1 = 6 & a[6] > 0, therfore a[6] *= -1
	a = [4,-3,-2,-7,8,2,-3,1]
5.	val = 8 => idx = abs(8)-1 = 7 & a[7] > 0, therfore a[7] *= -1
	a = [4,-3,-2,-7,8,2,-3,-1]
6.	val = 2 => idx = 1 but a[2] < 0. No change.
7.	val = -3 => idx = abs(-3)-1 = 2 but a[2] < 0. No change.
8.	val = -1 => idx = abs(-1)-1 = 0 & a[0] > 0, therefore a[0] *= -1
	a = [-4,-3,-2,-7,8,2,-3,-1]
Observation: Notice index 4 and 5 have positive values, since those values were never
encountered, so the values at those indexes never became negative. Hence missing values are
5 and 6.

This problem is phrased poorly and I had to read the comments by other users to understand what it required from me. The link I marked here explains the logic pretty good. But the simple logic is this: The number of rounds $r = \frac{Total Test Time}{Minutes To Die} +1$. Each pig has chances of dying in each round or staying alive till the end, so we plus 1. Now given the number of rounds $r$ and the number of samples $s$, how many volunteers $v$ will you need? $r^v = s$. Each round has some volunteers which in total at the end should be able to test out all the samples. Therefore, $v =\log_rs$.

```java
public int poorPigs(int buckets, int minutesToDie, int minutesToTest) {
    int base = minutesToTest/minutesToDie+1;		// How many rounds can you perform?
    return (int)Math.ceil(Math.log(buckets)/Math.log(base));

### [Repeated Substring Pattern](https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-substring-pattern/submissions/)<a name="repeated-substring-pattern"></a>
We use the [KMP Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kmp-algorithm-for-pattern-searching/) that allows us to match a string 's' with another string 'p' to find the longest sequence of characters in 's' that match 'p'. We can use a Naive Pattern match where we start from the beginning of the string and start comparing the characters of 's' with 'p'. Initially, we keep the partition at index 0. If the character's match, we move partition to the right by 1 till we get to the end of the string. If something doesn't match, we don't move the partition but look at the next character to match. In the end, wherever the partition is, that's our longest length we could match with string 'p'. The complexity of that is <i>O(len(p)(len(s)-len(p)+1))</i>.

KMP fixes it by skipping characters that we know already match. In this problem, we aren't matching with any other string but itself. So, we start from index 1 of the string and compare it from the beginning. If they match, we increase j by 1, note it down in lps array and then increase i by 1 to check the next character. j basically measures the longest chain of characters we were able to match. If we couldn't match character at index i and if streak was greater than 0, then our new streak becomes whatever it was in the previous round of matching characters. If the streak is 0, then we simply note down at index i in our lps array 0, meaning longest length measured upto index i was 0. 

```java
public boolean repeatedSubstringPattern(String s) {
        int maxLength = lps(s);
        return maxLength > 0 && s.length() % (s.length() - maxLength) == 0;
    }

private int lps(String s){
    int len = s.length();
    int[] lps = new int[len];
    int i = 1;		// To match the string with itself.
    int j = 0;
    while (i < len){

### [Island Perimeter](https://leetcode.com/problems/island-perimeter/)<a name="island-perimeter"></a>
The idea is simple. Count the number of cells with value 1 which denotes the land. Check towards the left and up to that cell and check if it shares any edge with another cell with value 1. If it does record that. In the end, the formula for perimeter is 4 * (the number of land cells) - 2 * (overlapping edges).

**Reasoning:** Perimeter of a square is 4 times the length of it's side. Here all squares are of length 1. So total perimeter is 4*(number of cells with value = 1). But we also need to account the edges that are common between two adjacent land cells. If one square shares an edge with another, we just lost one side from both the square, resulting in a loss of two sides. Therefore, we need to subtract twice the number of overlapping edges from the total perimeter to get  the total perimeter. 

```java
public int islandPerimeter(int[][] grid) {
    int land = 0;
    int overlap = 0;
    for (int row = 0; row < grid.length; ++row)
        for (int col = 0; col < grid[0].length; ++col){
            if (grid[row][col] == 1){
                ++land;
                if (row-1 > -1 && grid[row-1][col] == 1)	// Check above the current cell.
                    ++overlap;		// If it's a land, we need to record one overlap.
                if (col-1 > -1 && grid[row][col-1] == 1)	// Similarly, check to the left.
                    ++overlap;		// If it's a land, we need to increment overlap
            }
        }
    return 4*land - 2*overlap;		// Check the reasoning above.
}
```



### [Number Complement](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement/)<a name="number-complement"></a>
```java
public int findComplement(int num) {
    int pow2 = 1;				// Easily keep track of power of 2.
    int comp = 0;				// Complement number
    while (num != 0){			// Since num gets divided by 2, it will be 0 in the end.
        int bit = num % 2 == 0 ? 1 : 0;	// If bit is 0 then complement is 1 & vice versa.
        comp += bit * pow2;		// Multiply it by the appropriate power of 2 and add to comp
        pow2 *= 2;				// Update power of 2 for next iteration.
        num /= 2;				// Divide num by 2 to get the next bit.
    }
    return comp;				// Comp is now the complement.
}
```



### [Binary Watch](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-watch/)<a name="binary-watch"></a>
The idea is as follows. We have 10 lights. First 4 represent hours. Namely 1, 2, 4 and 8, which are the first four powers of 2. The next 6 lights, represent minutes. Those are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32. These are powers of 2 from 0-5. So if we iterate from 1 to 9, powers of numbers 1-3 gives us hours and powers of numbers 4-9 minus 4 gives us minutes. So, if we have, let's say 2 lights, we need to find every combination of 2 lights. So in our helper function, we iterate from 1-9 to check every hour and minute combination. We also need to keep a track of the lights that we used, so we don't use the same light again. If hours are > 11 or minutes are > 59, we have an invalid time and we can abort. If the number of lights are 0, that means we found a valid time and we should add it to the result. Now, if the lights are not 0, then we need to check every possible combination from the last light used to 9. If i < 4, then we are looking at an hourly combination, otherwise it's a minute combination. So we recurse with updated lights used, decrease the numOfLights since we used one, update respective hours or minutes until we hit base case.

```java
List<String> result;

public List<String> readBinaryWatch(int num) {
    result = new ArrayList<>();
    helper(0, num, 0, 0);
    return result;
}

private void helper(int lightsUsed, int numOfLights, int hrs, int min){
    if (hrs > 11 || min > 59)		// Base case. Invalid time
        return;

    if (numOfLights == 0){			// All lights used, so add time to the list.
        result.add(hrs + ":" + (min < 10 ? "0" + min : min));
        return;
    }
    for (int i = lightsUsed; i < 10; i++){	// Otherwise start recursing from number of prev
        if (i < 4)							// light used. i < 4 means hours
            helper(i+1, numOfLights-1, hrs + (int)Math.pow(2, i), min);
        else								// i = [4,9] means minute. So recurse.
            helper(i+1, numOfLights-1, hrs, min + (int)Math.pow(2,i-4));
    }
}
```



### [Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-moves-to-equal-array-elements/)<a name="minimum-moves-to-equal-array-elements"></a>
This was an interesting problem. But after working out a few examples by hand, you can notice that it is always a question of bringing the minimum element in par with everyone. So if you know the minimum of the array, we can check how many steps it will take to bring the minimum in par with other element by calculating the distance between them. For example,

> Let the array be [1,2,3]
>
> We can observe that the minimum here is 1. Let us list down all steps to make all elements equal.
>
> 1. [2,2,4], Keeping the second element fixed. Notice that distance between the element where 1 was and where 3 was is till the same.
> 2. [3,3,4], Keeping the last element fixed.
> 3. [4,4,4], Keeping last element fixed.
>
> Here, we first tried to make 1 equal to it's neighbor, which required us 1 step. Now, once it becomes equal to 1, the problem is how to make the last element in the original array, which is 3 equal to 1. It requires 2 steps, resulting in a total of of 3. The reason is that the moment you decide to increment the minimum element to match the next element, you fix the neighboring element and have to increment everything else. This will make the minimum and its neighbor the same, but it will also keep the distance between the minimum and all other elements the same because we just incremented everything. 
>
> So, the total number of moves required is the distance between the elements of the array and the minimum.

```java
public int minMoves(int[] nums){
    int min = nums[0];
    for (int i: nums)
        if (i < min)
            min = i;
    int moves = 0;
    for (int i: nums)
        moves += i-min;
    return moves;
}
```

> Now the above solution required two passes of the array. Can we do even better? Notice that in the end, all we are doing is finding the min and subtracting min from all the elements in the array. That means we are subtracting min *n* times where n is the length of the array. Why *n* times? Because there are *n* elements in the array. Shouldn't it be *(n-1)* times? No, because the distance of the min from min is 0. So we need to subtract min from itself too, so *n* times. We can achieve this by first calculating the total of the array while simultaneously keeping track of the minimum. Once done, all we need to do is subtract min *n* times from the sum, which is equivalent to subtracting min from each element. This results in a much overall better algorithm, requiring only 1 pass of the array.

```java
public int minMoves(int[] nums) {
    int sum = 0, min = nums[0];
    for (int i: nums){
        sum += i;
        if (i < min)
            min = i;
    }
    return sum - min*nums.length;
}
```



### [License Key Formatting](https://leetcode.com/problems/license-key-formatting/)<a name="license-key-formatting"></a>
The idea is simple. 

1. I maintain a temporary array *s* that contains only the characters in string *S* after converting them to uppercase.
2.  I maintain a variable *length* that counts how many characters I found in the string *S*. If length is 0, that means it contains only dashes (-). 
3. Then I record the *offset*. *Offset* basically measures how many characters of the String *S* will be grouped unevenly in the beginning part of the string. I can check that by using the modulus operator and finding out the remainder. That many characters (of *length < K*) will be in the beginning part of the string.
4. Next step is to calculate how many dashes I will need. It's basically *length / K*.
5. Then I create the char array that will hold the characters of the formatted key. It's length will be number of characters + the dashes we will need. We need to take care of a special case here. If the *offset* is 0, meaning I was able to divide characters in equal group, I need to subtract 1. Eg, let's say we had 8 characters and *K* was 4.  dashes = 8 / 4 = 2. We can divide 8 characters equally into 2 groups using only 1 dash. But since dashes was 2, it is clearly off by 1. This is the case when *offset* is 0.
6. *kIndex* tracks where character is to be inserted in the key array.
7. *used* tracks how many characters of the array *s*, which indirectly holds the characters of String *S*, are used.
8. First I copy down the characters of length *offset*. Because those are the ones of uneven length. *kIndex* and *used* variables are updated.
9. Last thing to do is to use all the remaining characters in array *s*, but we take *K* characters at a time, because we know that the segments are going to be of equal length. We also need to insert '-' after each segment, but only if *kIndex* is not at the beginning or at the end of the key array, because inserting it at those points is invalid.
10. Create a new string and return it.

```java
public String licenseKeyFormatting(String S, int K) {
    char[] s = new char[S.length()];
    int length = 0;
    for (char c: S.toCharArray())
      if (c != '-')
        s[length++] = Character.toUpperCase(c);
    if (length == 0)
        return "";
    int offset = length % K;
    int dashes = length / K; 
    char[] key = new char[length + dashes + (offset == 0 ? -1 : 0)];
    int kIndex = 0;
    int used = 0;
    while (used < offset)
      key[kIndex++] = s[used++];
    while (used < index){
      if (kIndex > 0 && kIndex < key.length)
        key[kIndex++] = '-';
      for (int i = 0; i < K; ++i)
        key[kIndex++] = s[used++];
    }
    return new String(key);
}
```



### [Max Consecutive Ones](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones/)<a name="max-consecutive-ones"></a>
Solution 1: I came up with this solution initially. 4 ms runtime and passes 99.97% submissions.

```java
public int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(int[] nums) {
    int start = 0;					// Keep track of start of a streak, if any
    int max = 0;					// max length of the streak
    while (start < nums.length){	// While we are not at the end of the array
        if (nums[start] == 1){		// Check if we have a 1 at start, if so
            int streak = 0;			// initialize streak and check how long can we continue
            while (start < nums.length && nums[start] == 1){	// that streak.
                ++streak;			// Increment streak and left for each consecutive 1
                ++start;			// make sure you don't forget that start < nums.length
            }						// before checking nums[start] to prevent out-of-bounds
            if (streak > max)		// Check if the current streak is better than the
                max = streak;		// previous streak.
        }
        ++start;					// Increment start in either case to check for new
    }								// streaks.
    return max;
}
```



Solution 2: After analyzing the problem further, I noticed that 0 denotes the end of a streak. If we observe 1, we increment streak by 1. But if I see a 0, I reset my streak to 0. This solution too had a 4 ms runtime and passed 99.97% submissions.

```java
public int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(int[] nums) {
    int max = 0;				// Global max streak
    int streak = 0;				// Local max streak.
    for (int i: nums){			// For each number in nums
        if (i == 1){			// If we see a 1
            ++streak;			// increment our ongoing streak.
            if (streak > max)	// If the local streak > global max
                max = streak;	// update global max streak.
        }
        else					// otherwise we just saw a 0.
            streak = 0;			// So our streak resets to 0.
    }
    return max;					// return the global max streak.
}
```



### [Permutations](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/)<a name="permutations"></a>
The idea is as follows. Given an array a = {1,2,3}, we want to generate all it's possible combinations. What we are trying to do here is that we first take the element at index 0, and find permutations of the remaining thing. When we do that, we insert the element at index 0 in front of the list to get 1 permutation. Similarly, we then take the element at index 1, and permute the remaining contents of the array and insert the element at index 1 in the beginning of the array to get another permutation and so on. In this problem, we are asked to return a list of list, so we first copy the numbers of the array into an ArrayList. Let's run this code for the above example.

> Given nums = {1,2,3}, our ArrayList will be the same, al = [1,2,3]. Our result list is empty, result = [] and index = 0.

### [Construct the Rectangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-the-rectangle/)<a name="construct-the-rectangle"></a>
The idea is very simple. We just need to iterate from width = sqrt(area) to 1 and check if area is perfectly divisible by width. If at any point, width is divisible, then that must be our minimum difference length and width, because we are diverging from the center on both sides. Width decreases while length keeps increasing. Think of it like this, for area = 24, we have many factors of 24, namely 1, 2, 3,4, 6, 8, 12, 24. It's sqrt when rounded down is 4. So we check for width = 4, is 24 perfectly divisible by 4? Yes, so divide it and whatever you get is going to be the minimal difference values. Suppose 4 and 6 weren't the factors for 24. In that case we decrease width by 1, which is 3. Check again, is 24 divisible by 3. Yes? Then that must be our answer. We are diverging away from the center on both sides equally, width to the left towards 1 and length to the right towards area . Therefore the moment we find one value that divides area perfectly, that's our required values.

```java
public int[] constructRectangle(int area) {
    int[] dimensions = {area, 1};		// We know that if nothing works out, n*1 is always
    boolean done = false;				// going to be the answer
    int width = (int)Math.sqrt(area);	// We only need to check width from sqrt(area)
    while (!done){						// While not done
        if (area % length == 0){		// check if area is perfectly divisible by width
            dimensions[0] = width;		// if so, we found our width and the length.
            dimensions[1] = area/width;
            done = true;				// mark done as false
        }
        --width;						// otherwise decrease the length
    }
    return dimensions;					// return the dimensions found.
```



### [Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/)<a name="merge-intervals"></a>
```java
public List<Interval> merge(List<Interval> intervals) {
    if (intervals == null || intervals.size() < 2)
        return intervals;
    Collections.sort(intervals, (a,b) -> a.start-b.start);	// Sort the list so we can 
													// compare adjacent intervals.
    List<Interval> merged = new ArrayList<>();
    merged.add(intervals.get(0));					// Add the initial interval.

    for (Interval i: intervals){					// For each interval
        Interval last = merged.get(merged.size()-1);// Get the last added time.
        if (i.start > last.end)						// If it's time is greater than the last
            merged.add(i);							// interval's end, it doesn't overlap
        else{										// otherwise it does.
            last.end = last.end > i.end ? last.end : i.end;	// So check which has greater end time, and make the last added interval's time equals that
            merged.set(merged.size()-1, last);		// And set it as the last added interval
        }
    }

    return merged;									// Return the merged list.
}
```



### [Merged sorted lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/)<a name="merged-sorted-lists"></a>
1. counterA keeps track of which element we are looking at in array 'a'. Same with counterB
2. counterK keeps track of where to insert the element in array 'a', since a has enough space. The problem states that it might have more than enough space, so we use only the spaces we need, which is the total of both their sizes. Since indexing in an array is 0-based, we subtract 1.
3. We insert elements from the end, since the end part of 'a' is empty. We can insert from the front, but then we would need to shift elements to the right after each insertion from 'b'.
4. If array values are equal, add them to the end, and decrease both their counter to check new values in the next iteration
5. If not equal, then check which one is greater, since the last part of the array should contain larger values. Whichever's greater, put it in 'a' at index 'counterA' and decrement the respective counter.
6. In the end, we might have some leftover elements either from 'a' or 'b' because we only process elements that are equal to the **min(size(a), size(b))**, until we run out of elements in one of the array. So, whichever array has elements pending, add it to the front of the array and return a.

```java
public int[] merge(int[] a, int sizeA, int[] b, int sizeB)
{
    int counterA = sizeA-1, counterB = sizeB-1, counterK = sizeA+sizeB-1;
    while (counterA > -1 && counterB > -1){
        if (a[counterA] == b[counterB]){
            a[counterK--] = a[counterA--];
            a[counterK--] = b[counterB--];
        }
        else
            a[counterK--] = a[counterA] > b[counterB] ? a[counterA--] : b[counterB--];
    }
    while (counterA > -1)
        a[counterK--] = a[counterA--];

### [Relative Ranks](https://leetcode.com/problems/relative-ranks/)<a name="relative-ranks"></a>
The idea employed here is simple. We need to store the relative ranks in sorted order. We can sort the array for that, but that is O(n log n). We can do better than that by finding the relative rank in linear time. First we find the maximum score in the array and create another array of length = maxScore + 1. We add 1 so that when we see the maxScore in the nums, we can assign it to maxScore index. Once we have done that, now we iterate over the nums array. Variable i keeps track of what rank to assign. We check a value in the array and at that index in our reverse sorted array, we put i+1, which basically marks it's rank based on it's position in the rankings. Some of then indexes would be default, that is a score of 0. We then check each value in the descend array and if it's not 0, we assign it a rank, but not if the ranks are 1, 2 or 3. In that case, we assign it a special value of Gold, SIlver or Bronze.

```java
public String[] findRelativeRanks(int[] nums) {
    int maxScore = nums[0];
    for (int n: nums)
        if (n > maxScore)
            maxScore = n;
    int[] descend = new int[maxScore+1];
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i)
        descend[nums[i]] = i+1;
    String[] result = new String[nums.length];
    int rank = 1;
    for (int i = descend.length-1; i > -1; --i){
        int idx = descend[i];
        if (descend[i] != 0){
            if (rank == 1)
                result[idx-1] = "Gold Medal";
            else if (rank == 2)
                result[idx-1] = "Silver Medal";
            else if (rank == 3)
                result[idx-1] = "Bronze Medal";
            else
                result[idx-1] = rank + "";

### [Longest Uncommon Subsequence I](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-uncommon-subsequence-i/)<a name="longest-uncommon-subsequence-i"></a>
This is those kind of problems that shouldn't be up there. The problem is stated rather poorly and the solution is even stupider. All you are checking for is if the two string's aren't the same, then whichever one has a larger length is essentially the longest uncommon subsequence because the other string cannot form the full string. I know, it's stupid.

```java
  public int findLUSlength(String a, String b) {
      if (a.equals(b))
          return -1;
      return a.length() > b.length() ? a.length() : b.length();
  }

### [Course Schedule II](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/)<a name="course-schedule-ii"></a>
This is a graph problem where we require to sort the vertices topologically. There are two choices we have for sorting topologically - Depth First Search approach based on finshing times or the Kahn's Algorithm. I have used Kahn's algorithm in this solution. Runtime is 2ms [beats 100%] and uses 45.3 MB space [beats than 90.16%]. The idea for Kahn's is simple - Enqueue all the nodes which has 0 incoming edges because those are the ones that can be started first. Then while the queue isn't empty, remove one node at a time, process it's outgoing nodes and decrease their indegrees by one. The reasoning behind that is let's say Node 2 has two prerequisites, Node 0 and Node 1. Node 0 and Node 1 have 0 indegrees. So our first two nodes would be Node 1 and Node 0 and if they are finished, then their outgoing Nodes can be started, that is Node 2. Now when you decrease any node's indegree and they become zero, add them to the queue because they can now be started. Keep doing this until the queue is empty.

In my approach, I'm avoiding any unnecessary data structure and using only the most basic ones like array's. So instead of using the queue, what I do is fill the array `order` which also stores the topological order. `idx` keeps track of the last index available to fill in the array. `start` mimics the `poll` behaviour of a queue. `while (start != idx)` makes sure that while we still have nodes to process, remove the one that can be started and decrease all the indegrees of outgoing edges.

```java
public int[] findOrder(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
    int[] indegrees = new int[numCourses];				// We maintain each node's indegree
    List<Integer>[] graph = new ArrayList[numCourses];	// Each node's outgoing edges
    for (int[] edge: prerequisites) {					// Process each edge
        indegrees[edge[0]]++;							// Update indegrees
        if (graph[edge[1]] == null)						// Also store the edge in graph
            graph[edge[1]] = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        graph[edge[1]].add(edge[0]);
    }
    int[] order = new int[numCourses];		    // We don't technically need a queue.
    int idx = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; ++i)        // Find all nodes who indegree is 0
        if (indegrees[i] == 0)                  // and put them in the order array
            order[idx++] = i;
    int start = 0;                              // start tracks node to be polled.
    while (start != idx) {                      // while we can poll the queue
        int u = order[start++];                 // poll the node u
        if (graph[u] != null)                   // If node u has outgoing edges 
            for (int out: graph[u])             // Then for each of those nodes
                if (--indegrees[out] == 0)      // decrease their indegrees and check if it's 0
                    order[idx++] = out;         // if it's 0, add it to our queue (order)
    }
    if (idx != numCourses)						// Cycle check. If our idx != numCourses then
        return new int[] {};					// not all nodes could be processed. So we have
    return order;								// a cycle. Otherwise return our order array.
}

---

How do we count numbers? 16, 17, 18, 19 and then what? 20 right? We see that the last number is 19, we can't go past 9 so we set it to 0 and then increment the precedding digit to get 20. The idea is the same for this problem too. We keep a `levels` array to keep track of which character do we take from which number's allowed alphabet letters. For example, let's say the input string is `23`. Our `levels` array would `[0, 0]` in the beginning. This says pick characters at index 0 and 0 from alphabet characters corresponding to 2 and 3 which gives us `ad`. Then, we increase the last most counter in our levels array by 1 giving us `[0, 1]`. This allows us to get `ae` in the next iteration and levels array would be `[0, 2]`. We get `af` and levels array becomes `[0, 3]`. Now this is where it becomes interesting. We are only allowed three letters for the digit corresponding to 3 and since we already used all of them , we now need to shift to the next character for digit 2, which is `b`. Level array looks like `[1, 0]`. This will allow us to get `[b,e]`. So you get the rough idea now. Only thing now is we watch out when to stop. We stop when we have utilized all available characters from the 0th index's number's allowed alphabet letters. In this case, we stop when levels array look like `[3, 0]`.

```java
class Solution {
	private char[][] map = {
            {'a', 'b', 'c'},        // 2

            {'g', 'h', 'i'},        // 4
            {'j', 'k', 'l'},        // 5
            {'m', 'n', 'o'},        // 6

            {'t', 'u', 'v'},        // 8
            {'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'}    // 9
    };

    private List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();                // Maintain the list of combinations

### [Bulls and Cows](https://leetcode.com/problems/bulls-and-cows/)<a name="bulls-and-cows"></a>

Runtime: 1 ms, faster than 100.00% of Java online submissions for Bulls and Cows.

Memory Usage: 36.3 MB, less than 100.00% of Java online submissions for Bulls and Cows.

The idea is simple, first record the frequency of the digits of the secret number. Then we first find number of `bulls` by checking for exact indices match. After that we start to record the number of `cows`. The way we do is by again iterating over the `guess` string; only if there was a character mismatch and we still have the character available from `freq` table, we have a `cow`. Update it and decrement the frequency of the number we just used up.

```java
public String getHint(String secret, String guess) {
    int bulls = 0;
    int cows = 0;
    int[] freq = new int[10];							// Freq of available digits from secret
    for (int i = 0; i < guess.length(); ++i) {
        char s = secret.charAt(i);
        freq[s - '0']++;								// Record the freq of the digit
        if (s == guess.charAt(i)) {						// If it's a match, we have a bulls.
            bulls++;
            freq[s - '0']--;							// We just used the character, so decrement it.
        }
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < guess.length(); ++i) {
        int s = secret.charAt(i) - '0';					// Convert the chars into int
        int g = guess.charAt(i) - '0';
        if (s != g && freq[g] > 0) {					// Only if they are a mismtach and we have a number g available in freq table
            cows++;										// then it's a cow.
            freq[g]--;									// We used up the number, so decrement it's freq.
        }
    }
    
    return new StringBuilder().append(bulls).append("A").append(cows).append("B").toString();

Memory Usage: 37.6 MB, less than 100.00% of Java online submissions for N-Queens.

The idea is same as sudoku, but insteading of scanning rows, we scan columns. Start with row 0, column 0 and see if we can place a queen there, if yes place it and try the next cell of row 0 by recursing. We can't put the queen in the same row again, so we keep changing rows with column 1 until we find somewhere to place it. Keep doing this until you were successfully able to place all the queens as checked by the condition `col == n`. If so, add that solution to our list of accepted solutions.

```java
public class NQueens {

    private int[][] board;
    private int n;
    private List<List<String>> result;

    public List<List<String>> solveNQueens(int n) {
        this.n = n;
        board = new int[n][n];
        result = new ArrayList<>();
        solve(0);
        return result;
    }

                    return true;
                }
                else

            list.add(sb.toString());
        }
        result.add(list);
    }

### [K-diff pairs in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-diff-pairs-in-an-array/)<a name="k-diff-pairs-in-an-array"></a>

Pretty intuitive solution. Build a frequency HashMap for all the numbers in the array. In a special case where `diff` is 0, just count occurences in our `freq` map whose values are 2 or more. In other case, just loop through all the keys and make sure it's supplement exists to count the number of K-diff pairs.

```java
public int findPairs(int[] nums, int k) {
    if (k < 0)
        return 0;
    int pairs = 0;
    HashMap<Integer, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i: nums) {
        freq.put(i, freq.getOrDefault(i, 0)+1);
    }
    if (k == 0) {
        for (int i: freq.values())
            if (i > 1)
                pairs++;
        return pairs;
    }
    for (int i: freq.keySet()) {
        if (freq.containsKey(i+k))
            pairs++;
    }
    return pairs;
}

### [Minimum Absolute Difference in BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-absolute-difference-in-bst/)<a name="minimum-absolute-difference-in-bst"></a>

The idea is to use the Inorder traversal of a BST. We repeatively iterate over the left branch to find the minimum diff and then do the same for the right branch, but this time we already know that the parent of the right branch has to be its minimum, so first set it and then traverse the right branch to find the minimum difference.

```java
int res = Integer.MAX_VALUE;								// Hold the minimum difference.
int prev = Integer.MAX_VALUE;								// Holds the minimum value observed for the right branch

public int getMinimumDifference(TreeNode root) {
    traverse(root);											// Start iterating from the root.
    return res;
}

private void traverse(TreeNode node) {
    if (node == null)										// Null node, so stop recursion
        return;
    traverse(node.left);									// Keep traversing till the end of the tree
    res = Math.min(Math.abs(node.val-prev), res);			// Check if we have a minimum, if so set it.
    prev = node.val;										// The smallest value for the right branch is it's parent
    traverse(node.right);									// Set it first and then traverse.
}
```

### [BST Tree to Greater Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-bst-to-greater-tree/)<a name="bst-tree-to-greater-tree"></a>

The idea is simple. In a BST, we know everything on the right side of a node is greater than it and it's left side. So when we are at any node, it's value would be its value + sum of everything on its right side. So, we first compute the node's value and then notice that the value for the node on the left is nothing but its value + parents value. So the node's value is computed, do the same thing for the left side, but this time, the starting sum would be the parent's value.


```java
public TreeNode convertBST(TreeNode root) {
    traverse(root, 0);
    return root;
}

private int traverse(TreeNode node, int sum) {
    if (node == null)
        return sum;
    node.val += traverse(node.right, sum);
    return traverse(node.left, node.val);
}
```

          if (c == 'A') {								// If c is A, increment A
              A++;
              if (A > 1)								// If A is more than 1, return false
                  return false
              L = 0;										// Always set L count to 0
          }
          else if (c == 'L') {					// If c is L,
              L++;											// We might have consecutive L's, so start counting
              if (L > 2) {							// If we have more than 2 consecutive L's
                  return false;					// return false
              }
          }
          else													// Lastly, we might have a P, that will reset our

### [Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-zigzag-level-order-traversal/)<a name="binary-tree-zigzag-level-order-traversal"></a>

The idea here is simple. We perform a BFS as usual using a Queue but I maintain a variable called `dir` to check which side do I add from. `dir=1` means add from Right->Left and `dir=-1` means add from usual Left->Right. I am also using LinkedList because of easy addition of elements in both direction. When I need to add from Right->Left, I use the `addFirst(E e)` method of LinkedList to add to the head, otherwise normal add to the tail. One important thing to take care of at each iteration is to know how many nodes to dequeue, hence the usage of the variable `children`. This allows me to keep track of how many children were added to the queue at each stage so I dequeue exactly that many children in the next stage. Apart from that, everything is straightforward.

```java
public List<List<Integer>> zigzagLevelOrder(TreeNode root) {
      List<List<Integer>> list = new LinkedList<>();
      if (root == null)
          return list;
      Queue<TreeNode> q = new LinkedList<>();
      q.add(root);										// Children = 1 because only root is added.
      int dir = 1, children = 1;			// Added the root, so next time dir = 1 (Right->Left)
      while(!q.isEmpty()) {
          int pushed = 0;
          LinkedList<Integer> l = new LinkedList<>();
          for (int i = 0; i < children; ++i) {		// Poll only those nodes that were queued in
              TreeNode u = q.poll();							// the previous stage.
              if (dir == 1)
                  l.add(u.val);
              else
                  l.addFirst(u.val);							// Left->Right add
              if (u.left != null) {								// Add children, notice I am counting here
                  q.add(u.left);									// how many children I am pushing/queuing
                  ++pushed;												// to the queue
              }
              if (u.right != null) {							// Same thing for right child.
                  q.add(u.right);
                  ++pushed;
              }
          }
          list.add(l);														// Add this list to main list
          children = pushed;											// update # of children pushed
          dir = dir == 1 ? -1: 1;									// update dir for next iteration

      }

Runtime: 3 ms, faster than 99.90% of Java online submissions for Array Partition I.

Memory Usage: 40.1 MB, less than 100.00% of Java online submissions for Array Partition I.

I originally came up with the sorting solution where you sort the array and look at two numbers at a time and keep the smaller number out of them and add to the sum. It was way slower, so I checked the fastest submission and this one is pretty smart. The idea is really good. We know there are going to be 20,001 numbers, so reserve an array for it. Now let's say we had duplicates in our array, ex [1,2,1,4,1,1], if we were to sort it, we would get [1,1,1,1,2,4]. Notice that those four 1's don't really matter because each of them pairs up with the other to give you a one 1. That is why we mark those particular indices as true and false. Notice that in our variable `sum` we would have counted them individually, making `sum = 4` when in fact it should be 2 since we only take one of them from two pairs. If we have even occurrence of any number, they would be false, meaning we don't need to account them in the `diff` calculation. Now coming to `diff` how do we compute it? First we have the `seen` array to know which elements we need to look at. If that particular index is true, then we check if it's the first element of the pair which we maintain via the boolean value `firstElemOfPair`. If its true, then `first` becomes that value. Otherwise, we know that we're looking at the second element so we update the `diff` which is basically that value subtract `first`. Notice that if we look at a pair in our example as (2,4), we would pick 2 and the `diff` would be 2. This needs to be subtracted from our `sum`, hence the reason to maintain both of them. At the end, we finally subtract sum and diff and divide the result by 2 because we were doubling our diff's too.

```java
public int arrayPairSum(int[] nums) {
      boolean[] seen = new boolean[20001];
      int sum = 0;
      for (int n: nums) {
          seen[n + 10000] = !seen[n+10000];
          sum += n;
      }
      int diff = 0;
      int first = 0;
      boolean firstElemOfPair = true;
      for (int i = 0; i < seen.length; ++i) {
          if (seen[i]) {
              if (firstElemOfPair)
                  first = i;
              else
                  diff += i-first;
              firstElemOfPair = !firstElemOfPair;
          }
      }
      return (sum-diff)/2;
  }

### [Swap Nodes in Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-nodes-in-pairs/)<a name="swap-nodes-in-pairs"></a>

Runtime: 0 ms, faster than 100.00% of Java online submissions for Swap Nodes in Pairs.

Memory Usage: 34.5 MB, less than 100.00% of Java online submissions for Swap Nodes in Pairs.

The idea is simple. We add a dummy node in front for simplicity as it allows us to generalize the concept of getting two nodes at a time. We maintain a current pointer that points to the node in the actual LinkedList. Then, we get it's next and it's next.next and store it into n1 and n2. Now notice that before making n2's next = n1, we need to store n2's next into n1's next. After we do that, we need to make sure that current's next is n2 which is now working with the actual LinkedList. Then, we need to make sure that current.next.next is n1 which we just fixed and update current which is basically n1.

```java
public ListNode swapPairs(ListNode head) {
    ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
    dummy.next = head;
    ListNode curr = dummy;
    while (curr.next != null && curr.next.next != null) {
        ListNode n1 = curr.next;
        ListNode n2 = n1.next;
        n1.next = n2.next;
        curr.next = n2;
        curr.next.next = n1;
        curr = curr.next.next;
    }
    return dummy.next;
}

### [Generate Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-parentheses/)<a name="generate-parentheses"></a>

Iterative Approach 1: This one is very slow.

Runtime: 4 ms, faster than 8.87% of Java online submissions for Generate Parentheses.

Memory Usage: 36.1 MB, less than 100.00% of Java online submissions for Generate Parentheses.

The idea is simple. We basically do a BFS and keep track of the parentheses combination we have obtained so far. Poll the queue and check if it's length is 2*n (for a given n, we would have # of open brackets = # of closed brackets), add it to the list and check next combination. If not, then check if we can add an open bracket, add it and update number of open bracket count and add this combination to the queue. Then try to see if we can add a closed bracket, if you can add it, then update closed bracket count add that combination to the queue. Keep doing this until the queue becomes empty. This is the first approach I came up with which is naive as you can see since it's doing an exhaustive search for all valid combination.

```java
private class Node {
    private String data;
    private int open;
    private int close;

    Node(String s, int o, int c) {
        data = s;
        open = o;
        close = c;
    }
}

public List<String> generateParenthesis(int n) {
    List<String> list = new LinkedList<>();
    Queue<Node> q = new LinkedList<>();
    q.add(new Node("(", 1, 0));
    while (!q.isEmpty()) {
        Node u = q.poll();
        if (u.data.length() == 2*n)
            list.add(u.data);
        else {
            Node n1 = new Node(u.data, u.open, u.close);
            Node n2 = new Node(u.data, u.open, u.close);
            if (n1.open < n) {
                n1.data = u.data + '(';
                ++n1.open;
                q.add(n1);
            }
            if (n2.close < u.open) {
                n2.data = u.data + ')';
                ++n2.close;
                q.add(n2);
            }
        }
    }
    return list;
}
```

Recursive Solution 2: This one is much more faster. I generalized the above idea into the fact that I am adding only valid combinations and any invalid combinations are automatically discarded. The logic is as follows: We know for a given n, the string length should be 2*n. So that forms our base case for recursion, if the length of String `s` is `2n`, we want to add it to the list. Otherwise, we check if the number of open brackets we have so far is less than `n`. If so, we can add an open bracket. Then check if number of close bracket is less than `open`, if so that sequence would be valid and add a close bracket and recurse.

###[Distribute Candies](https://leetcode.com/problems/distribute-candies/)<a name="distribute-candies"></a>

Pretty simple solution. We want to give maximize the number of unique candies to give to the sister. So we maintain a hashset to collect all the unique candies first. Both of them get half the candies, so let `s = number of candies they get`. Now, if the size of the set is greater than or equal to `s`, then the sister only gets `s` candies out of it. Otherwise, the maximum amount of unique candies she can get is equal to the set size.

```java
public int distributeCandies(int[] candies) {
    Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>(candies.length);
    for (int i: candies)
        set.add(i);
    int share = candies.length/2;
    return set.size() >= share ? share: set.size();
}

### [Maximum subproduct subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-subarray/)<a name="maximum-subproduct-subarray"></a>

Credits for this simplistic solution to LeetCode user [mzchen](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-subarray/discuss/48230/Possibly-simplest-solution-with-O(n)-time-complexity). The approach is very clever. Notice that if this problem was about finding maximum sum subarray, then a negative number would break the contiguous array. Here, what it does is that it makes our maximum product minimum when we see a negative number and vice versa. We keep track of maximum and minimum we have so far and check if we have a negative number. If so swap our max and min. Then, find the local maximum and minimum between current number and multiplying that number with our current max or min. After that, update our global max value and keep doing this for all values in the array.

```java
public int maxProduct(int[] nums) {
    int max = nums[0];
    for (int i = 1, imax = max, imin = max; i < nums.length; ++i) {
        if (nums[i] < 0) {
            int temp = imax;
            imax = imin;
            imin = temp;
        }

        imax = Math.max(nums[i], imax * nums[i]);
        imin = Math.min(nums[i], imin * nums[i]);
        max = Math.max(max, imax);
    }
    return max;
}

Memory Usage: 36.3 MB, less than 100.00% of Java online submissions for Binary Tree Right Side View.

This is an interesting problem cause initially, I thought we would always have a complete binary tree and I made my initial solution oriented towards it. But then I saw that it doesn't say that anywhere and it could be any kind of binary tree. So it got me thinking towards a more generalized approach. Notice that to get a right side view of the binary tree, we only need the last value at any given level and put it into the list. So we maintain a queue and also the number of elements we enqueue at each stage. Initially, we put the root node in our queue and our enqueue count is 1. We dequeue exactly that many elements and again enqueue each of those dequeued node's children. Notice that I am using the variable `newEnqueued` to keep track of newly enqueued elements. Lastly, we need to check if we dequeued the last element. If so, that must be a part of the solution since it has to be the rightmost element at that level, so I add it to the list. Update `enqueued` to the new value and repeat until our queue isn't empty.

```java
public List<Integer> rightSideView(TreeNode root) {
    List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
    if (root == null)
        return list;
    Queue<TreeNode> q = new LinkedList<>();
    q.add(root);
    int enqueued = 1;
    while (!q.isEmpty()) {
        int newEnqueued = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < enqueued; ++i) {
            TreeNode u = q.poll();
            if (u.left != null) {
                q.add(u.left);
                ++newEnqueued;
            }
            if (u.right != null) {
                q.add(u.right);
                ++newEnqueued;
            }
            if (i == enqueued-1)
                list.add(u.val);
        }
        enqueued = newEnqueued;
    }
    return list;
}

Logic is same as your In-Order traversal of any Binary Tree, but store the node values you visit in any data structure. Here I am using an ArrayList for storing each of the visited node's value. Maintain `idx` value to keep track of which value to return. `hasNext()` method returns true as long as `idx < list.size()`.

```java
class BSTIterator {
    
    private List<Integer> list;
    private int idx = 0;

    public BSTIterator(TreeNode root) {
        list = new ArrayList<>();
        traverse(root);
    }
    
    private void traverse(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null)
            return;
        traverse(node.left);
        list.add(node.val);
        traverse(node.right);
    }
    
    /** @return the next smallest number */
    public int next() {
        return list.get(idx++);
    }
    
    /** @return whether we have a next smallest number */
    public boolean hasNext() {
        return idx != list.size();
    }
}
```

### [Find Peak Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/)<a name="find-peak-element"></a>

This question was asked to me for my internship at Yahoo! The idea is simple, we want any one of the peak. So to achieve `O(log n)` time, we have to mimic binary search algorithm. We look at the middle element and check it's neighbor, if it's greater than the middle element, then we know we will have atleast one peak on the right side. Why? Think what could happen. We know that the element next to middle is greater than it, so there are two possibilities on the right side, either elements keep increasing to the right of the middle's next element or we might go up till a particular index and then go down. So in any case, we will have a peak on the right side. On the other case, if the element on the right side is smaller than the middle, then we know that the left half including the middle will have the peak cause middle is already greater than middle's right, so we might have middle as the peak itself.

```java
public int findPeakElement(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 1)
        return 0;
    int low = nums[0], high = nums.length - 1, mid;
    while (low < high) {
        mid = (low + high)/2;
        if (nums[mid] < nums[mid+1])
            low = mid+1;
        else
            high = mid;
    }
    return low;
}

Memory Usage: 40.3 MB, less than 47.00% of Java online submissions for Next Permutation.

This one was quite interesting in the sense it seems difficult but is very simple once you try out a few example. If we want to find the next lexicographical greater number, then we need to find a particular index from the right side of the array such that the number after it is greater than itself, because by swapping them would give us a next larger number. So what I first do is find the index of the number such that `num[idx] > num[idx-1]`. We know at this point that all the numbers after that index are reverse sorted, so we need to fix it and sort them in increasing order because lexicographical order demands all the numbers in increasing manner. Example, say `nums = [2,3,1,4,2,1,0]`. You can see that that the next number should be `[2,3,2,0,1,1,4]`. Notice that I replaced the number at index 2 with the first number which is greater than it if the array after index 2 was sorted. This gaurantees us a larger lexicographical number. So the first while loop finds us that index number and then I reverse the array after it. Once you reverse it, we should expect the `nums` array to look like `[2,3,1,0,1,2,4]`. Note that now we need to find the number larger than the number at index 2, which is 1 in this case. The first number greater than 1 is 2, so the second while loop finds it and then we simply swap them to give us the next larger lexicographically greater number => `[2,3,2,0,1,1,4].`

```java
public void nextPermutation(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length < 2)
        return;
    int idx = nums.length-1;
    while (idx > 0 && nums[idx] <= nums[idx-1])
        --idx;
    reverse(nums, idx);
    if (idx == 0)
        return;
    int val = nums[idx-1];
    int i = idx;
    while (i < nums.length && nums[i] <= val)
        ++i;
    swap(nums, i, idx-1);
}

private void swap(int[] arr, int idx1, int idx2) {
    int temp = arr[idx1];
    arr[idx1] = arr[idx2];
    arr[idx2] = temp;
}

private void reverse(int[] arr, int start) {
    int end = arr.length-1;
    while (start < end)
        swap(arr, start++, end--);
}
```

### [Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)<a name="search-in-rotated-sorted-array"></a>

The idea is same as binary search except you need to keep track of which half to stay in. We compute the middle index and the value at that index. If the middle value is the target, then return that index. Otherwise, find the correct half. If the number on the left side is < middle value then we know that between the left and middle index, values are increasing. We only need to now check if target is < middle value, if so we need to adjust our right pointer otherwise adjust the left pointer. If left value is not < middle value then we are at a shift where the array is pivoted. We again need to confirm now which half to take. There would be some index `i` such that `nums[left] > nums[i] < nums[mid]` and value are increasing upto `i` and shifts from index `i` onwards. In this case, we again need to adjust our index pointers and we repeat this loop until `left <= right`

```java
public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = nums.length-1;
    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = (left + right)/2;
        int midVal = nums[mid];
        if (target == midVal)
            return mid;
        else if (nums[left] <= midVal) {
            if (target < midVal && target >= nums[left])
                right = mid - 1;
            else
                left = mid + 1;
        }
        else {
            if (target > midVal && target <= nums[right])
                left = mid+1;
            else
                right = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

### [Transpose Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/transpose-matrix/)<a name="transpose-matrix"></a>

Pretty straightforward. Create matrix B of opposite dimensions to those of A. We maintain `br` and `bc` which tracks row and columns of B. We iterate over each element of A and put it in `B[br][bc]` and then ideally we would increment `bc` for an exact copy, but since we want transpose, we increment `br` and then reset it to 0 if we fill all the values in a row and increment column count, giving us the tranpose of the matrix.

```java
public int[][] transpose(int[][] A) {
    int[][] B = new int[A[0].length][A.length];
    int br = 0, bc = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < A.length; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < A[0].length; ++j) {
            B[br][bc] = A[i][j];
            if (++br == B.length) {
                br = 0;
                ++bc;
            }
        }
    }
    return B;
}
```

### [Merge K Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/submissions/)<a name="merge-k-sorted-lists"></a>

This was an onsite interview question at ThousandEyes. The idea is simple. Basically, we have multiple sorted lists so we have access to one value at a time, that is head of the lists initially and the consecutive nodes. So we need to fetch the minimum element out of all of them in constant time. The easiest way for us to do this is to use a PriorityQueue and define the logic of comparision of two ListNodes. Then, we add all the nodes inside the PQ and build our resulting List. Fetch the minimum valued ListNode and add it to our list. Then we also need to update that particular list's head, so we  add that list's next in the PQ so the next time it is fetched, we fetch the correct node of the list. Repeat this until the list is empty and return dummy's next node.

```java
public ListNode mergeKLists(ListNode[] lists) {
    if (lists.length == 0)
        return null;
    PriorityQueue<ListNode> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(lists.length, (n1, n2) -> n1.val - n2.val);
    for (ListNode ln: lists)
        if (ln != null)
            pq.add(ln);
    if (pq.isEmpty())
        return null;
    ListNode node = new ListNode(-1);
    ListNode ret = node;
    while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
        node.next = pq.poll();
        node = node.next;
        if (node.next != null)
            pq.add(node.next);
    }

    return ret.next;
}
```
